Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually
non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in
the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers
slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on
quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to
each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent
harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations, and obtain a very
large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% at low temperatures. There is little temperature
dependence up to about 500 K, but it increases at higher temperatures. Our approach is general
and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free
energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
There has been intense research on graphene since
its discovery in 2004, and also on multilayer graphene
systems. Among many other interesting properties, flat
bands are present in multilayer rhombohedral (ABC-
stacked) graphene (RG)1, and in fact, superconductiv-
ity has been observed in RG in 20212. Several works
recently studied, both experimentally and theoretically,
under which conditions RG can form3–8. In particu-
lar, some of us unveiled how the stacking of graphene
layers changes under shear stress9, and obtained that
it produces many consecutive layers of RG. In fact, all
samples with long-range RG that have been observed so
far have been subject to some form of shear stress5,10–14,
and thus of friction.
To move graphene layers with respect to each other,
they have to overcome a free energy barrier that sepa-
rates different minima. When doing so, they experiment
“stick-slip” motion: they move gradually with increas-
ing shear stress, followed by sudden rearrangements and
decrease of the stress15. The maximum shear-stress to
“unlock” layers is correlated with the height of the bar-
rier. Such barrier corresponds to the activation energy
of a metastable state, where a graphene flake (from
nanometers up to possibly micrometer scales) sitting on
top of a large graphene layer is displaced relative to the
equilibrium position. In clean samples with micrometer
sized flakes however, different regions can have different
stackings (AB and AC)12,16, and a domain wall in the
metastable state separates both regions. The displace-
ment of layers in this case is more complex and is not
considered in our work.
Superlubricity is another phenomenon present in sys-
tems involving graphene layers or graphite that hasattracted a lot of attention17,18, in which the energy
landscape corresponding to the relative displacement of
graphene layers is also central. Yet another phenom-
ena involving sliding surfaces is thermolubricity, which
refers to the assistance from thermal excitations to over-
come barriers. This term has been coined by some
works that have studied the transition from stick-slip
motion into stochastic fluctuations in friction at suffi-
ciently high temperatures19. A few works have studied
how quantum effects, including zero-point renormaliza-
tion (ZPR) and tunneling, affect the free-energy barrier
of dissociative adsorption20and diffusion21–23of hydro-
gen. However, there are no studies of the quantum ef-
fects and temperature dependence of free-energy barri-
ers in macroscopic systems.
A quantity closely related to the free energy barrier
is the shear frequency, corresponding to the mode in
which layers move rigidly in-plane and out of phase
around the equilibrium position. The free energy bar-
rier separates two equivalent minima, so the barrier and
shear frequency are expected to have a similar tem-
perature dependence (a lower curvature at the min-
ima corresponds to a lower shear frequency and a lower
free energy, at least close to the minima). The value
of the shear frequency in graphite is a relatively well-
established quantity, with experimental values24oscil-
lating between 42 - 45 cm−1, using for example in-
elastic X-ray scattering25, neutron-coherent inelastic
scattering26, Raman spectra27,28, and coherent phonon
spectroscopy29. In bilayer graphene, there are some ex-
periments with values around 30 cm−1; for example, 28
±3 cm−1in Refs. 29 and 30, and 32 cm−1in Ref. 27.
The temperature dependence of the shear modes, how-
ever, has been barely studied. Few experiments measure
the temperature dependence of the shear mode, using
Raman scattering in folded 2+2 (4 layer) graphene31,arXiv:2407.04532v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  4 Apr 20252
or femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy in graphite32.
Another aspect of multilayer graphene and graphite
that still needs further investigation and that serves
as a consistency check on the adequacy of our ap-
proach is thermal expansion (TE). Ref. 33 mea-
sured it in bilayer and trilayer graphene for the first
time. Ref. 34 uses the quasi-harmonic approxmima-
tion (QHA), which underestimates the out-of-plane TE
at low temperatures35and has a very rapid increase
at high temperatures; in-plane, it also underestimates
the TE at low temperatures35and overestimates it at
high temperatures36. Much better out-of-plane results
were obtained by using path integral molecular dynam-
ics (PIMD)37, but while the TE flattens at 500 K in
graphite, experimental values continue increasing36,38.
However, in-plane PIMD results of Ref. 37 vastly over-
estimate the TE.
Motivated by the aforementioned phenomena, espe-
cially by the lack of understanding of quantum effects
in friction, we focus on studying the ZPR and temper-
ature effects of the free-energy barrier. This is a very
challenging problem due to the difficulty of determin-
ing the free energy in a non-equilibrium position. Here
we tackle it using the state-of-the-art stochastic self-
consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA)39. First,
in Sec.II, we briefly introduce SSCHA and the QHA,
and explain how is the barrier determined. Then, in
Sec. III, we present our main results and compare to
the height of the barrier with fixed atoms. Subsequently,
using also the QHA, we calculate the temperature de-
pendence of the shear frequency and compare to the lim-
ited experimental data available. Finally, we determine
the in-plane and out-of-plane TE coefficient in bilayer
graphene and graphite, and compare our results to pre-
vious theoretical and experimental work. In Sec. IV, we
summarize the conclusions of our work.
II. THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL
FRAMEWORK
Here, we briefly describe the QHA, SSCHA, and a
new SSCHA interpolation method used to determine the
barrier. We also introduce the equation that is used to
fit SSCHA thermal expansion results. A more detailed
description of SSCHA can be found in Refs. 40 or 39.
A. Quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA)
In the QHA, at each value of the lattice parameters
{ai}, the free energy F(T,{ai}) =U({ai})−TS(T,{ai})
is given by the standard harmonic expression. That is,F(T,{ai}) =Ulat({ai}) +1
NX

The value of the lattice parameters at a given temper-
ature, ai(T), is determined by minimizing the free en-
ergy. Using an interatomic potential, the phonon fre-
quencies at each value of the lattice parameters can be
determined with little computational effort, and thus
the QHA offers a quick method to determine the lattice
expansion. Using first-principles calculations, phonons
can be determined using density functional perturba-
tion theory (DFPT), which uses a primitive cell and is
much faster than frozen phonon (finite differences) cal-
culations in supercells. However, it does not account
for the “true anharmonicity”41, present at fixed values
of the parameters when varying temperature. For ex-
ample, it gives an increasing as opposed to decreasing
temperature dependence of the G mode in graphene,
due to the negative TE of the lattice parameter. Also,
if the TE is negative and the lattice parameter reduces
below the classical lattice value, as in the case of mono-
layer graphene at about 400 K (see later Fig. A10), then
an acoustic mode becomes unstable and the QHA is ill-
defined. These issues are not present in SSCHA.
B. Stochastic self-consistent harmonic
approximation (SSCHA)
In general, the free-energy of a ionic Hamiltonian H=
T+Vis given by
FH= tr( ρHH) +1
βtr(ρHlnρH), (2)
where ρHis the density matrix. In SSCHA, the density
matrix is restricted to a trial harmonic Hamiltonian H=
T+V, and the free energy is given by
FH(H) = tr( ρHH) +1
βtr(ρHlnρH). (3)
Due to a variational principle, FH≤ F H(H). The
parameters of the harmonic Hamiltonian Hinclude the
centroids of the atoms, which correspond to the lattice
parameters aiof the QHA, but it also includes the in-
teratomic force constant matrix, which contains the in-
formation of all the phonon frequencies and accounts
for the true anharmonicities. Thus, SSCHA has addi-
tional parameters, and is expected in general to give3
better results than QHA. Also, QHA does not satisfy a
variational principle. It can be shown that
FH(H) =FH+Z
dR[V(R)− V(R)]ρH(R),(4)
where Rindicates a general ionic configuration and
ρH(R) =⟨R|e−βH|R⟩/ZHis the probability density of
finding the crystal in a generic configuration R(ZH=
tr[e−βH] is the partition function). By stochastically
sampling configurations Rfor a given density matrix
ρH, and determining the gradient of the free energy
with respect the harmonic parameters (centroids and
force constant matrix elements), the free energy can be
minimized self-consistently. Thanks to the variational
ansatz, the SSCHA quantum free energy is rigorously
defined, even in out-of-equilibrium and unstable config-
urations like SP. Notably, on the other hand, the QHA
cannot determine the barrier, since the harmonic fre-
quencies are not well defined at SP.
The logarithm term in the harmonic term Eq. (1) can
be hard to converge for low frequencies. Separating the
total free energy as in Eq. (4) allows to interpolate the
auxiliary harmonic term up to a very fine q-mesh, which
is fundamental to avoid oversampling the energy of the
long-ranged shear modes, while the anharmonic contri-
bution can be properly converged already with small
simulation cells. So rather than calculating FHdirectly
with the grid corresponding to the SC used in the min-
imization procedure, the force constant matrix can be
Fourier interpolated in the usual way, and FHcan be
calculated using a dense mesh.
This procedure is followed both at SP and the equi-
librium position, and the barrier is obtained by taking
the difference of the corresponding free energies. More
technical details are provided in the Appendix, Sec. A1.
The SSCHA frequencies are in principle auxiliary fre-
quencies that minimize the free energy. In a purely
harmonic system, such frequencies correspond to the
physical frequencies. But in general, they have to be
corrected with the so-called “bubble correction” (and
also an additional higher order term in very anharmonic
cases)39, which we do in Sec. III B to obtain the temper-
ature dependence of the shear frequency. Convergence
with the supercell size of both the physical and auxiliary
frequencies can be seen in the Appendix, Fig. A5.
C. Thermal expansion (TE)
As opposed to the barrier, the thermal expansion
(TE) can also be calculated using the QHA, which al-
though is much faster, is also in principle less accurate.
With both QHA and SSCHA we determine the in-plane
and out-of-plane lattice parameters as a function of tem-
perature, a(T) and c(T), to then determine the in-planeand out-of-plane coefficients of TE, αa(T) =1
ada
dTand
αc(T) =1
cdc
dT. In the QHA case, the TE can calcu-
lated quickly and accurately for many temperatures, so
we just use finite differences. For SSCHA, to reduce
numerical error, we use Eq. (6) of Ref. 42,
b(T) =b0expXθ
eX/T−1
, (5)
which depends on parameters b0,Xandθ, to fit a(T)
andcd(T) (bcan be aorcd). Then we determine the
coefficients of TE from the derivative of the fit.
III. RESULTS
A. Barrier
We first focus on studying bilayer graphene, where
the in-plane and (most importantly) out-of-plane inter-
actions are given by the interatomic potential of Ref. 43
and Ref. 44, respectively. The out-of-plane interactions
determine the barrier. The energy profile of a layer mov-
ing with respect to the other one along the bond direc-
tion is given by Fig. 1, which gives good reults when
comparing to theory and experiment (see Table I).

quency at fixed ionic positions (classical at T= 0 K) between

adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem within
the random phase approximation (ACFDT-RPA)45and ex-
perimental data24.

The lower layer is fixed in position A, and there are
two minima of the same energy, AB and AC, at a dis-
tance of a bond length d= 1.42˚A. For layers to slide
with respect to each other, they have to overcome a bar-
rierVSP. SP is a saddle point in the full energy land-
scape, so the shear mode in the perpendicular direction
(along the direction of two nearby AA maxima) is sta-
ble. In order to determine the ZPR and temperature
dependence of the barrier, we use SSCHA to determine
the free energy at the equilibrium position and SP, using
the interpolation method described in Sec. II B.4

FIG. 1. Energy profile of bilayer graphene when moving one
layer relative to the other along the bond direction. The
lower layer is fixed in position A. Configuration AA (one
layer on top of each other) is the least favorable configura-
tion. There are two minima of the same energy, AB and
AC, which correspond to the two stable configurations. To
go from one minima to the other one applying shear stress,
the upper layer has to overcome the barrier VSP, which has
a value of 1.24 meV/atom relative to the minima. The dia-
grams below illustrate the different configurations, with the
upper layer (darker blue) moving relative to the lower one
in position A (lighter blue).
The barrier as a function of temperature can be seen
in Fig. 2. The barrier is reduced by an outstanding 35%
with respect to the value at fixed nuclei. Classically,
ionic vibrations reduce at low temperatures (and are ex-
actly 0 at T= 0 K), so it might be expected that such
reduction is due to quantum fluctuations. However, the
shear modes, which play a significant role in the reduc-
tion, have very low frequencies, around 25 cm−1∼35
K (given by the curvature around AB in Fig. 1). So, at
100 K, they are still well activated and behave virtually
in a classical way. In fact, almost all of the contribution
to the barrier at 100 K comes from the anharmonic term
in Eq. (4), as opposed to the quantum fluctuations in
the harmonic piece.
To confirm that quantum fluctuations are very minor
down to 100 K, we performed SSCHA calculations in the
classical limit ℏω/kT →0 (which recovers the classical
Boltzmann distribution for the distorted configurations)
at 100 K and 300 K. We obtained comparable results,
except for a small difference of less than 0.05 meV/atom
at 100 K with respect to the quantum values. Much
lower temperatures would have to be considered to re-
cover the classical value at fixed ions. Thus, it is the
anharmonic vibrations that play a decisive role in the
ability of layers to slide with respect to each other.
In a previous work9, using density functional theory
with an LDA functional (see Table 1), some of us ob-
tained that the maximum shear stress in simulated stick-

FIG. 2. Barrier as a function of temperature. It is re-
duced from 1.24 meV/atom, the value at fixed nuclei (V SP
in Fig. 1), to about 0.8 meV/atom, corresponding to a large
reduction of about 35% due to anharmonicities. The barrier
does not change much up to about 500 K, but the value at
1000 K is about 20% smaller relative to the value at 100 K.
The lines are a guide to the eye, as in the other figures of
this work.
slip motion is 0.2 GPa, and we mentioned a good agree-
ment with experimental values 0.14 GPa (Ref. 15) and
0.1 GPa (Ref. 46). Assuming the maximum shear stress
decreases by 35% just like the barrier, we obtain 0.13
GPa, in excellent agreement with experiments.
Other systems involving hydrogen diffusion across a
free energy barrier do present significant differences be-
tween classical and quantum free energy barriers due
to the large quantum fluctuations of hydrogen. Such
differences have been observed at 100 K (Ref. 20), 250
K (Ref. 22), and even higher temperatures21, although
other works23obtain very similar barriers at already 200
K.
Regarding the evolution of the barrier as the tem-
perature increases, there is a weak dependence up to
about 500 K, since the barrier remains close to around
0.8 meV/atom. However, when temperature increases
up to 1000 K, the barrier is further reduced by 20%
relative to the value at 100 K. Thus, high temperatures
should help to reduce (static) friction between layers. In
particular, it could aid the production of ABC-stacked
multilayer graphene from its more common AB-stacked
version through shear stress, as mentioned in the Intro-
duction. More in general, high temperatures could also
help engineer specific stacking arrangements in other
layered materials.
B. Shear frequency
At the equilibrium position, one of the vibrational
modes at Γ is the shear mode in both directions of the
plane (doubly degenerate, see Fig. 3). Its temperature5
dependence can be determined using both SSCHA and
QHA. In the QHA, the TE is obtained by determining
the lattice parameters that minimize the free energy at
each temperature.
The third out of phase mode of the layers is the
breathing mode, in the out-of-plane direction. A dis-
cussion of its temperature dependence can be found in
the Appendix.
The temperature dependence of the shear frequency
can be seen in Fig. 4. The quantum effects evaluated
within the SSCHA harden the shear frequency energy
at low temperatures compared with the classical value
at 0 K (dashed line). On the other hand, the ZPR
in QHA softens the shear frequency. The temperature
dependence of the shear mode is similar to that of the
barrier, varying by about 20% from 0 to 1000 K, and
having a larger dependence at temperatures above 500
K.

FIG. 3. Bilayer graphene phonon dispersion. The inset
shows a zoom in close to Γ to better visualize the doubly
degenerate shear modes Sat Γ, and the breathing mode B.
Due to the high speed velocity in graphene, the region of
the shear mode in the BZ is small (a fraction of ΓM), and is
overrepresented in small supercell calculations. The breath-
ing mode, on the other hand, is flat, so nearby sampling
points are not necessary to converge the free energy.
Regarding the experimental data, in Ref. 31, the mea-
surements are done in 2+2 folded graphene (4 layers).
In order to compare with our 2-layer calculations, we
multiply by a correction factor using a nearest-neighbor
model for layers47. In the case of bulk, such a factor
is√
2 (the force exerted by a layer below and above,
proportional to the square of the frequency, is doubled
when considering only nearest neighbor interactions),
which we use to compare to the bulk measurements of
Ref. 32. The temperature dependence of both SSCHA
and QHA curves is similar to the experimental adjusted
bulk values. Folded graphene values have a steeper de-
pendence but are likely unsuitable for comparison, be-
cause layers fold with different rotational angles, while

show a similar temperature dependence (adjusting the
bulk value by a√
2 factor) of roughly -0.5 cm−1/100 K.
C. Thermal expansion
To further check the adequacy of our method (the use
of SSCHA with the in-plane43and out-of-plane44inter-
atomic potentials), we look at the TE in the previous
calculations and also in bulk graphite, and compare to
experiments.
In Fig. 5, we show the TE coefficient calculated with
SSCHA and QHA in bulk, compared with experimental
data35,38and PIMD calculations37. SSCHA curves re-
sult from fitting Eq. (5) to a(T) and c(T) (see Fig. A8)
and then taking the derivative. SSCHA results underes-
timate the thermal expansion. PIMD results are over-
all very good, although they also give values somewhat
lower than experiments35,38.
In-plane SSCHA calculations give excellent results.
QHA works well at low temperatures but departs from
experiments at higher temperatures. PIMD calculations
of Ref. 37, although they work very well out-of-plane,
greatly overestimate in-plane TE, presumably due to
the inadequacy of their interatomic potential. It would
be interesting in future work to compare SSCHA and
PIMD using the same potentials.6

IV. CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, we demonstrated that anharmonicities
are fundamental to determining properties of layered
materials that account for friction. Using the self-
consistent harmonic approximation, which can calculate
the quantum free energy at unstable configurations, and
a novel interpolation method, we unveiled the suppres-
sion of the barrier separating stable configurations in
bilayer graphene. Anharmonicities reduce the free en-
ergy barrier by 35%, and gets further reduced at high
temperatures. On the other hand, quantum fluctuations
are not important down to 100 K. The shear modes,
which occupy a small region of phase space, have to be
adequately sampled to correctly determine the free en-
ergy barrier as well as the thermal expansion. Althoughour approach underestimates the out-of-plane thermal
expansion compared with experimental values, in-plane
agreement with experiments is excellent. We also ob-
tained that the temperature dependence of the barrier
is similar to that of the shear frequency, which agrees
well with existing measurements.

APPENDIX
A1. Barrier
To determine the barrier, the free energy has to be
determined at the equilibrium position and SP. At the
equilibrium position, there are two shear modes, indi-
cated with Sin Fig. 3(b). The mode perpendicular
to the bond direction shown in Fig. 1 is stable in SP,
while the shear mode along the reaction coordinate (us-
ing the language of chemical reactions) is unstable. As
opposed to the breathing mode, that is flat around Γ,
the shear modes are only present in a small region of
the BZ (1 /N2, with Nlarger than 20), as a result of the
large speed of sound in graphene. So in small supercells,
the shear modes will be over-represented. This is more
problematic at SP, where the SSCHA frequency corre-
sponding to she unstable mode takes very small values
(see Fig. A1), which makes the convergence of the free
energy hard, mostly due to the logarithm term in FHin
Eq. (4). Just determining the barrier with this equation
and a N×N×1 supercell, results in Fig. A2, which is
not well converged.
In order to get better convergence, we use the in-
terpolation method mentioned in Sec. II B, and obtain
a much more stable barrier as a function of 1 /N(see
Fig. A3). The 40 ×40 interpolation grid used for FH
corresponds to a supercell of 6400 atoms. For 100, 200
and 300 K, the barrier seems well converged. For a 1000
K, the trend seems to indicate convergence within 0.02
meV/atom, so for the intermediate temperatures 400
and 500 K, the barrier is likely also converged within a
similar error, resulting in Fig. 2 of the main text.
To better understand the reduction in the barrier, we
show in Fig. A4 the SSCHA frequencies (around the
shear modes) at equilibrium and SP at T= 100 K.
The SSCHA frequencies at equilibrium are similar to the7
standard harmonic values, as shown in the main text.
The SSCHA shear frequencies at SP instead change sig-
nificantly. The shear mode that looks like an acous-
tic mode takes a value of about 2 cm−1at Γ (see also
Fig. A1). The rest of the SSCHA phonon dispersion
presents small differences between equilibrium and SP
frequencies.

verged value might be similar to the QHA. The bulk
temperature dependence (corrected with the factor of
the nearest neighbor model) agrees very well with QHA.
The other mode at Γ that involves the layers mov-
ing out of phase is the breathing mode (out-of-plane
instead of in-plane). Its temperature dependence can
be seen in Fig. A6. It decreases more at low tempera-
tures compared to the shear mode and barrier. There
are no measurements of the breathing mode as a func-
tion of temperature, so our calculations serve as a pre-
diction. The SSCHA curve is very well converged, so
we expect it to have a temperature dependence that
is closer to the experiment relative to the QHA curve.
The auxiliary frequency for N= 8 and 10 is almost
the same (Fig. A7), so the physical values are also con-
verged (within 0.5 cm−1at 1000 K, and less for lower
temperatures).8

A3. Thermal expansion (TE)
For the SSCHA out-of-plane TE calculations, we also
used the interpolation scheme with a 40 ×40 grid. The
interlayer distance and in-plane lattice parameter ob-
tained in bulk with SSCHA can be seen in Fig. A8. The
derivative of these fits results in the SSCHA curves of
Fig. 5.
In Fig. A9 we compare SSCHA and QHA for bilayer
graphene and bulk. The TE for both SSCHA and QHA
bulk is lower relative to bilayer. In-plane, Fig. A10,
we can also see a clear reduction of the TE coefficient
from monolayer to bulk. In what follows, we describe in
detail convergence studies we did for SSCHA, and also

the free energy by varying both aandcd. In Fig. A11
we can see cd(T) both for fixed a, and for the full min-
imization. The full minimization has a slightly larger
dependence with temperature, but fixing ais a good
approximation. Fig. A12 is analogous for a(T), with
a fixed value cd= 3.5˚A. The curves are very similar,
except for a small difference at high temperatures (of
about 0.0005 ˚A at 1000 K).
We also studied convergence with the size of the grid
(Fig. A13). At N= 12, cd(T) is well converged (within
0.005 ˚A at 1000 K), although N∼20 to achieve full
convergence. The shear mode increases thermal expan-
sion because when layers are displaced relative to each
other, the interlayer distance is larger (see Fig. A14).
In-plane, a larger Nof about 50 is needed to fully
achieve convergence (Fig. A15).
SSCHA. Out-of-plane convergence is similar to the
QHA case. So N= 12 should give a good curve for
cd(T). We also see in SSCHA a similar variation of cd
when changing a(compare Figs. A11 and A18).
On the other hand, a(T) has less variation with tem-
perature relative to QHA and is already converged at
about N= 8 (Fig. A17).
b. Bulk
QHA. In bulk, there is virtually no difference for the
out-of-plane TE when fixing a, or considering also the
minimization of a(Fig. A19).
In-plane (Fig. A20), there is a small difference be-
tween both fixing or varying a, similar to the bilayer
case.
SSCHA. Here we also used the interpolation method
(40×40 grid), to go beyond the N= 8 supercell that
was possible in the direct SSCHA calculation, resulting
in the blue dots of Fig. A8 (a).
In-plane, based on N= 8 already giving converged
results in bilayer (Fig. A17), and also considering that
the QHA convergence in bulk (Fig. A23) is much faster
than in bilayer (Fig. A15), N= 8 should give converged
