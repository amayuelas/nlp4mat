Abstract
We classify and characterize all invertible anomalies and all allowed topological terms related
to various Standard Models (SM), Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT), and Beyond Standard Model
(BSM) physics.
By all anomalies, we mean the inclusion of (1) perturbative/local anomalies
captured by perturbative Feynman diagram loop calculations, classiﬁed by Z free classes, and (2)
non-perturbative/global anomalies, classiﬁed by ﬁnite group ZN torsion classes.
Our work built
from [arXiv:1812.11967] fuses the math tools of Adams spectral sequence, Thom-Madsen-Tillmann
spectra, and Freed-Hopkins theorem.
For example, we compute bordism groups ΩG
d
and their
invertible topological ﬁeld theory invariants, which characterize dd topological terms and (d −1)d
anomalies, protected by the following symmetry group G: Spin × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)

and others. For SM with an extra discrete symmetry, we obtain new anomaly matching conditions

Our approach oﬀers an
alternative view of all anomaly matching conditions built from the lower-energy (B)SM or GUT, in
contrast to high-energy Quantum Gravity or String Theory Landscape v.s. Swampland program, as
bottom-up/top-down complements. Symmetries and anomalies provide constraints of kinematics, we
further suggest constraints of quantum gauge dynamics, and new predictions of possible extended
defects/excitations plus hidden BSM non-perturbative topological sectors.

Introduction
1.1
Physics Guide
The world where we reside, to our present knowledge, can be described by quantum theory, gravity
theory, and the underlying long-range entanglement. Quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT), speciﬁcally gauge
ﬁeld theory, under the name of Gauge Principle following Maxwell, Hilbert, Weyl [1], Pauli, and others,
forms a cornerstone of the fundamental physics. Yang-Mills (YM) gauge theory [2], generalizing the
U(1) abelian gauge group to a non-abelian Lie group, has been proven theoretically and experimentally
essential to describe the Standard Model (SM) physics [3–5].
The SM of particle physics is a gauge theory encoding three of the four known fundamental forces
or interactions (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, but without gravity) in the universe. The
SM also classiﬁes all experimentally known elementary particles: fermions including three generations
of quarks and leptons, while bosons including the electromagnetic force mediator photon γ, the strong
force mediator gluon g, the weak force mediator W± and Z0 gauge bosons, and Higgs particle; while
the graviton has not yet been detected and is not in SM. Physics experiments have conﬁrmed that at
a higher energy of SM, the electromagnetic and weak forces are uniﬁed into an electroweak interaction
sector. Grand Uniﬁcations and Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT) predict that at further higher energy,
the strong and the electroweak interactions will be uniﬁed into an electroweak-nuclear GUT interaction
sector. The GUT interaction is characterized by one larger gauge group and its force carrier mediator
gauge bosons with a single uniﬁed coupling constant.1 Examples of GUT that we will encounter in this
article includes Georgi-Glashow SU(5) GUT [6], Fritzsch-Minkowski SO(10) GUT [7] and Pati-Salam
model [8] and others.
In our present work, we aim to classify and characterize fully all (invertible) anomalies and all allowed
topological terms associated with various Standard Models (SM), Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT), and
Beyond Standard Model physics (BSM) in 4d.2 Then we will suggest the dynamical constraints on SM,
GUT and BSM via non-perturbative statements based on anomalies and topological terms.
By “anomalies” of a theory in physics terminology, physicists may mean one of the following:
(1): Classical global symmetry is violated in a quantum theory, such that the classical global symmetry
fails to be a quantum global symmetry, e.g. Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly [9,10].
(2): Quantum global symmetry is well-deﬁned kinematically. However, there is an obstruction known
as ‘‘’t Hooft anomaly [11],” to gauge the global symmetry, detectable via coupling the charge
operator (i.e., symmetry generators or symmetry defects, which measures the global symmetry
1Unifying gravity with the GUT interaction gives rise to a Theory of Everything (TOE). However, in our present work,
the gravity only plays the role of the background probed ﬁelds instead of dynamical gravity.
As we will classify and
characterize, the background probed gravity also gives new constraints, such as in the gravitational anomaly or the mixed
gauge-gravitational anomaly. We however will comment the implications for dynamical gravity such as in Quantum Gravity
in Sec. 8.
2We denote dd means the d spacetime dimensions. The d + 1D means the d spatial and 1 time dimensions. The ¯DD
means the ¯D space dimensions.

charge of charged objects) to background ﬁelds.3 Speciﬁcally, we may detect an obstruction to
even weakly gauge the symmetry or couple the symmetry to a non-dynamical background probed
ﬁeld (sometimes as background gauge ﬁeld/connection). ‘‘’t Hooft anomaly [11],” is sometimes
regarded as a “background gauged anomaly” in condensed matter. Namely, the path integral or
partition function Z does not sum over background gauge ﬁelds. We only ﬁx a background gauge
ﬁeld and the Z only depends on the background gauge connection as a classical ﬁeld or as a classical
coupling constant.
(3): Quantum global symmetry is well-deﬁned kinematically. However, once we promote the global
symmetry to a dynamical local gauge symmetry of the dynamical gauge theory, then the gauge
theory becomes ill-deﬁned. Some people call this as a “dynamical gauge anomaly” prohibiting a
quantum theory to be well-deﬁned. Namely, the path integral after summing over dynamical gauge
ﬁelds becomes ill-deﬁned. Therefore, the anomaly-free or anomaly-matching conditions are crucial
to avoid the sickness and ill-deﬁneness of quantum gauge theory.
In fact, it is obvious to observe that the anomalies from (3) are descendants of anomalies from (2).
(α). Anomalies from (3) can be related to anomalies from (2) via the gauging principle.
(β). Anomalies from (2) can be related to anomalies from (3) via the ungauging principle.
Thus our key idea is that if we know the gauge group of a gauge theory (e.g., SM, GUT or BSM),
we may identify its ungauged global symmetry group as an internal symmetry group, say Ginternal via
ungauging.4
To start, we should rewrite the global symmetries of an ungauging theory into the form of
G ≡(Gspacetime ⋉Ginternal
Nshared
),
(1.1)
where the Gspacetime is the spacetime symmetry, the Ginternal is the internal symmetry,5 the ⋉is a semi-
direct product from a “twisted” extension,6 and the Nshared is the shared common normal subgroup
symmetry between Gspacetime and Ginternal.
In the later sections of our work, we write down the ungauged global symmetry groups G of SMs,
GUTs and BSMs. Then we should determine, classify and characterize all of their associated (invertible)
anomalies and topological terms. Moreover, based on the descendant relations between the anomalies
from (2) and (3), and the gauging/ungauging principles relate (α) and (β), we thus also determine both:
(A). For the ungauged SM, GUT and BSM theories:
Invertible ’t Hooft anomalies and background probed topological terms associated to a global symmetry
group G. This is related to a relation (β).
3Throughout our article, we explicitly or implicitly use the modern language of symmetries and higher symmetries of
QFTs, introduced in [12].
4By gauging or ungauging, also depending on the representation of the matter ﬁelds that couple to the gauge theory, we
may gain or lose symmetries or higher symmetries [12]. It will soon become clear, for our purpose, we only need to ﬁrstly
focus on the ordinary (0-form) internal global symmetries and their anomalies. See also Sec. 8.
5 Later we denote the probed background spacetime M connection over the spacetime tangent bundle TM, e.g. as
wj(TM) ≡wj where wj is j-th Stiefel-Whitney (SW) class. We also denote the probed background internal-symmetry/gauge
connection over the principal bundle E, e.g. as wj(E) ≡wj(VGinternal) where wj is also j-th SW class.
6The “twisted” extension is due to the symmetry extension from Ginternal by Gspacetime, for a trivial extension ⋉becomes
a direct product ×.
5
(B). For the gauged SM, GUT and BSM theories:
Dynamical gauge anomalies and dynamical topological terms associated to a gauge group G, descent
via the relation (α).
However, by far, there are some pertinent basic questions below that the readers may wonder. We
should provide the answers to the readers immediately:
[I]. What do we mean by all (invertible) anomalies and all topological terms? (See a disclaimer in Footnote 8.)
By “all (invertible) anomalies,” we mean the inclusion of:
(i). Perturbative local anomalies captured by perturbative Feynman diagram loop calculations, classiﬁed
by the integer group Z classes, or the so-called free classes in mathematics. Some selective examples from
QFT or gravity include:
(1): Perturbative fermionic anomalies from chiral fermions with U(1) symmetry, originated from Adler-
Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomalies [9,10] with Z classes.
(2): Perturbative bosonic anomalies from bosonic systems with U(1) symmetry with Z classes.
(3): Perturbative gravitational anomalies [13].
(ii). Non-perturbative global anomalies, classiﬁed by a product of ﬁnite groups such as ZN, or the so-
called torsion classes in mathematics. Some selective examples from QFT or gravity include:
(1): An SU(2) anomaly of Witten in 4d or in 5d [14] with a Z2 class, which is a gauge anomaly.
(2): A new SU(2) anomaly in 4d or in 5d [15] with another Z2 class, which is a mixed gauge-gravity
anomaly.
(3): Some higher ’t Hooft anomalies for a pure 4d SU(2) YM theory with a second-Chern-class topological
term [16–18] (or the so-called SU(2)θ=π YM): The higher anomaly involves a discrete 0-form time-
reversal symmetry and a 1-form center Z2-symmetry. The ﬁrst anomaly is discovered in [16]; later
the anomaly is reﬁned via a mathematical well-deﬁned 5d bordism invariant as its topological term,7
with additional new anomalies found for Lorentz symmetry-enriched four siblings of YM [17,18].
7We shall brieﬂy clarify the physical notations and usages of a co/bordism theory. More detailed mathematical deﬁnitions
are organized in Sec. 1.2. More physical interpretations of co/bordism invariants would be given in Sec. 7.
• bordism group: We denote it as ΩG
d , see (1.13). It is the set of equivalence classes of closed d-manifolds M with a
G-structure under the equivalence relation ∼. Here M ∼M ′ if and only if there is a compact d + 1-manifold N with a
G-structure such that the boundary of N is the disjoint union of M and M ′, and the G-structures on M and M ′ are
induced from the G-structure on N, see Fig. 1. The disjoint union operation on closed d-manifolds induces an abelian
group structure on ΩG
d .
• cobordism group: We denote it as Ωd
G ≡TPd(G) as the TP (topological phases) in Freed-Hopkins [19], see (1.4) and
(1.22). To be precise, this is not exactly the commonly deﬁned Pontryagin dual of the torsion subgroup (≡tors) of the
bordism group ΩG
d : Hom(ΩG,tors
d
, U(1)), as the homomorphism map to U(1). The Ωd
G and Hom(ΩG,tors
d
, U(1)) are only
the same for the ﬁnite group sectors (the torsion part), they are diﬀered by the integer Z classes (the free part). Also,
Freed-Hopkins [19] suggests that the torsion part (Ωd
G)tors ≡(TPd(G)))tors ≡ΩG,tors
d
classiﬁes the deformation classes
of reﬂection positive invertible d-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theories with a symmetry group G(d).
Alternatively, there is another kind of cobordism group deﬁned as Hom(ΩG
d , U(1)) in Ref. [20] by Yonekura. This group
classiﬁes the isomorphism classes of d-dimensional unitary invertible topological ﬁeld theories with the symmetry group
G(d). (We may denote G as G(d) because the spacetime symmetry sector can be d-dependent.)
Here are some physical meanings of the diﬀerent versions of cobordism groups:
– Ωd
G ≡TPd(G): Classify the G-symmetric invertible topological orders in d-dimension, with symmetry G(d).
– TPd(SO): Classify the bosonic invertible topological orders (iTO) in d-dimension, without any internal symmetry G
(but with a spacetime symmetry SO(d) group).
– TPd(Spin): Classify the fermionic invertible topological orders in d-dimension, without any internal symmetry G
(but with a spacetime symmetry Spin(d) group).
– TPd(G)/TPd(SO): Classify the G-symmetric bosonic SPTs in d-dimension, with symmetry G ⊇SO. (Mod out
TPd(SO) means that excluding the bosonic iTO protected by no internal symmetry.)
6
(4): Global gravitational anomalies [22].
By “all topological terms,” we mean the anomaly-inﬂow relation [23]: The (d −1)d anomalies can be
systematically captured by a one higher dimensional dd topological invariants or dd topological terms.
Recently Ref. [24] gives a non-perturbative description of anomaly inﬂow including both local and global
anomalies based on Dai-Freed theorem [25] and the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer η-Invariant [26].
– TPd(G)/TPd(Spin): Classify the G-symmetric fermionic SPTs in d-dimension, with symmetry G ⊇Spin. (Mod out
TPd(Spin) means that excluding the fermionic iTO protected by no internal symmetry except a fermionic parity
symmetry ZF
2 .)
– Hom(ΩG,tors
d
, U(1)): Classify the torsion (the ﬁnite subgroup Zn) classes of the G-symmetric invertible topological
orders, but which miss the integer Z classes.
– Hom(ΩG
d , U(1)): Classify the topological terms of G-symmetric phases. For example, Hom(ΩG
d , U(1)) includes the
Hom(ΩG,tors
d
, U(1)), which classiﬁes the ﬁnite subgroup Zn classes as the subclasses of the G-symmetric invertible
topological orders. However, Hom(ΩG
d , U(1)) also maps the Z ∈ΩG
d to U(1), which speciﬁes a theta angle θ ∈U(1),
which is in fact the θ-term in physics of G-symmetric phases.
Here are some physical and entanglement meanings of the aforementioned condensed matter phases, based on the
deﬁnition of deformation classes of the local unitary transformations [21]:
– invertible topological orders (iTO) includes both the invertible short-range and long-range entangled gapped phases
in condensed matter.
– Symmetry-Protected Topological states (SPTs) includes only the invertible short-range entangled gapped phases in
condensed matter [21].
• bordism generators: The generators of bordism group ΩG
d are the manifolds. We also call the bordism generators as
the manifold generators.
• cobordism generators: The generators of the torsion part of the cobordism group Ωd
G ≡TPd(G) are the reﬂection
positive extended d-dimensional invertible topological quantum ﬁeld theories (iTQFTs) with symmetry group G(d).
Its partition function Z(M d) on any closed manifold M d must have its absolute value |Z(M d)| = 1, namely Z(M d) = e i θ
can only be a complex phase which is invertible Z†(M d) = e−i θ. The generators of the cobordism group Ωd
G ≡TPd(G)
correspond to the d-dimensional invertible topological orders (iTOs) with a symmetry group G(d).
• bordism invariants vs cobordism invariants:
– Torsion part Zn class (bordism invariants ≡cobordism invariants): A bordism invariant is invariant for all manifolds
in the same equivalence class of bordism group. Thus, bordism invariants ϕ (given in our Tables, implicitly ϕ paired
with a manifold as
R
M ϕ = ⟨M, ϕ⟩) and partition functions of iTQFTs Z are related by ϕ 7→e
2π i k
n
ϕ (if ϕ is Zn
valued, and k ∈Zn speciﬁes the level of Zn class). Conventionally, bordism invariants and cobordism invariants
mean exactly the same for the torsion part.
– Free part Z class: bordism invariants ̸= cobordism invariants. For bordism invariants of the Z class of ΩG
d , the
bordism invariants ϕ (given in our Tables, implicitly ϕ paired with a manifold as
R
M ϕ = ⟨M, ϕ⟩) and partition
functions as the theta term Z are related by ϕ 7→Z = e i θϕ (if ϕ is Z valued, and the periodic θ ∈[0, 2π) in U(1)).
This bordism invariant of ΩG,free
d
is related to the cobordism invariants of Ωd−1
G,free ≡TPd−1(G)free. For cobordism
invariants of the Z class of Ωd−1
G
≡TPd−1(G), the bordism invariants ϕ and partition functions as the iTQFTs (as
a Z class of invertible topological order) Z are related by ϕ 7→Z = e i 2πkϕ (if ϕ is Z valued, and k ∈Z).
• reﬂection positive extended iTQFTs: Reﬂection positivity means stability, namely if we remove the condition of
reﬂection positivity in Freed-Hopkin’s theorem, then we should change the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTH to
ΣnMTH(n) where MTH is the colimit of ΣnMTH(n). Reﬂection positivity is also the manifestation of unitarity. An
extended n-dimensional TQFT means a symmetric monoidal functor from the (∞, n)-category of extended cobordisms
to another symmetric monoidal (∞, n)-category. There is also a conjecture in [19] that the full TPd(G) corresponds to
removing “topological” in the previous Freed-Hopkin’s theorem. Here “topological” means that the ﬁeld theory does
not depend on any continuously varying background ﬁelds, such as a spacetime metric or conformal structure.
• deformation classes v.s. isomorphism classes: There is a deformation between two theories if there is a continuous path
of theories connecting them. Two theories are isomorphic if there is a natural monoidal transformation between them.
• topological invariants vs. geometric invariants: We say that a cobordism invariant is topological if it can be deﬁned
purely using topological data, such as a cohomology class. While we say that a cobordism invariant is geometric if it
can be deﬁned purely using geometric data like metrics, connections, and curvatures. These two deﬁnitions have no
conﬂict, a cobordism invariant can be both topological and geometric.
• topological invariants vs. topological terms vs. iTQFTs: In physics, loosely speaking, for co/bordism invariants of a
cobordism theory, people sometimes interchangeably use topological invariants, topological terms, and iTQFTs for the
same thing. The G-iTQFTs with a global symmetry G (obtained from the cobordism invariants of cobordism group for
7
Therefore, by determining all (d −1)d anomalies, we also determine all dd topological terms, and vice
versa.8
[II]. What tools are we using to classify and characterize all anomalies and all topological terms?
The short answer is based on the Freed-Hopkin’s theorem [19] and our prior work [31–34].9
The long answer is follows. Based on the Freed-Hopkin’s theorem [19] and an extended generalization that
we propose [31,34], there exists a one-to-one correspondence between “the invertible topological quantum
ﬁeld theories (iTQFTs) with symmetry (including higher symmetries or generalized global symmetries
[12])” and “a cobordism group.” In condensed matter physics, this means that there is a relation from
iTQFT to “the symmetric invertible topological order (iTO, see a review [21]) with symmetry (including
higher symmetries) or symmetry-protected topological state (SPTs, see [21,36–38]) that can be regularized
on a lattice in its own dimensions.”
More precisely, it is a one-to-one correspondence (isomorphism “∼=”) between the following two well-deﬁned
“mathematical objects” (which turn out to be abelian groups):

(1.3)
We shall explain the notation above: MTG is the Madsen-Tillmann-Thom spectrum [39] of the group G,
Σ is the suspension, IZ is the Anderson dual spectrum, and tors means the torsion group by taking only
manifolds with a G-structure) describes the low energy physics of the short-range entangle SPTs in condensed matter.
However, in the general context, topological invariants and topological terms may not need to be invertible.
8There are however a disclaimer and some caveats:
(a) By all anomalies and all topological terms, their classiﬁcations and characterizations depend on the category of manifolds
that can detect them. The categories of manifolds can be: TOP (topological manifolds), PL (piecewise linear manifolds),
or DIFF (diﬀerentiable thus equivalently smooth manifolds), etc. These categories are diﬀerent, and they are related by
TOP ⊇PL ⊇DIFF.
(1.2)
Since the SM, GUT and BSM are given by continuum QFT data, in this work, we only focus on the DIFF manifolds and
their associated all possible anomalies and topological terms. However, if we reﬁne the data of QFT later in the future to
include PL or TOP data from PL or TOP manifolds, we may also need to reﬁne the corresponding SM, GUT and BSM.
Thus, we will have a new set of so-called all anomalies and all topological terms. The tools we use in either case would be
a certain version of cobordism theory suitable for a speciﬁc category of manifolds. See more in [27].
(b) By anomalies and topological terms for some SM, GUT and BSM theories in our work, we either mean
(A).Invertible ’t Hooft anomalies and background probed topological terms for the ungauged SM, GUT and BSM, or
(B).Dynamical gauge anomalies and dynamical topological terms for the gauged SM, GUT and BSM.
But after gauging G-symmetry of (A), for the gauged SM, GUT and BSM in (B), there could be additional new higher ’t
Hooft anomalies associated to the higher symmetries (depending on the group representations of the matter ﬁelds) whose
charged objects are dynamical extend objects (e.g. 1-lines, 2-surfaces, etc.). In this present work, we do not discuss these
additionally gained new higher ’t Hooft anomalies after dynamically gauging, but will leave them for future work [27].
Examples of such higher ’t Hooft anomalies can be found in [16–18,28,29] and References therein.
(c) Another possible loop hole is that we do only focus on invertible anomalies captured by invertible topological quantum
ﬁeld theories (iTQFTs), we do not study non-invertible anomalies (e.g. [30]). Diﬀerent experts and diﬀerent research ﬁelds
may regard and deﬁne anomalies in diﬀerent ways. After all, Laozi (600 B.C.) in Dao De Jing had long ago educated us
that “The Way that can be told of is not an eternal way; The names that can be named are not eternal names. It was
from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang.

Madsen-Tillmann-Thom spectrum (MTG) to a suspension shift (Σd+1) of the Anderson dual to the sphere
spectrum (IZ).
In other words, we classify the deformation classes of symmetric iTQFTs and also symmetric invertible
topological orders (iTOs), via this particular cobordism group deﬁned as follows

by classifying the cobordant relations of smooth, diﬀerentiable and triangulable manifolds with a stable
G-structure, via associating them to the homotopy groups of Thom-Madsen-Tillmann spectra [39,40], given
by a theorem in Ref. [19]. Ref. [19] introduced TP which means the abbreviation of “Topological Phases”
classifying the above symmetric iTQFT, where our notations follow [19] and [31]. (For an introduction of
the mathematical background and mathematical notations explained for physicists, the readers can consult
the Appendix A of [35] or [31].)
Now let us pause for a moment to trace back some recent history of relating these anomalies/topological
terms to a cobordism theory. The d dimensional ’t Hooft anomaly of ordinary 0-form global symmetries
is known to be captured by a (d + 1) dimensional iTQFT. In the condensed matter literatures, these (d +
1)d iTQFTs describe Symmetry-Protected Topological states (SPTs) or symmetric invertible topological
orders (iTO)10 [21, 36–38].
SPTs and symmetric iTO are interacting systems (interacting systems of
bosons and fermions at the lattice scale UV with a local Hilbert space) beyond the free fermion or K
theory classiﬁcation [41] for the (non-interacting or so-called free) topological insulators/superconductors
[42,43]. The relations between the SPTs and the response probe ﬁeld theory partition functions have been
systematically studied, selectively, in [35,38,44–46] (and References therein),11 and climaxed to the evidence
of cobordism classiﬁcation of SPTs [48,49]. Recently, the iTQFTs and SPTs are found to be systematically
classiﬁed by a powerful cobordism theory of Freed-Hopkins [19], following the earlier framework of Thom-
Madsen-Tillmann spectra [39,40].
A new ingredient in our work [31, 34] is a generalization of the calculations and the cobordism theory
of Freed-Hopkins [19] involving higher symmetries: Instead of the ordinary group G or ordinary classify-
ing space BG, we consider a generalized cobordism theory studying spacetime manifolds endorsed with
Gspacetime structure, with an additional higher group G (i.e., generalized as principal-G bundles) and higher
classifying spaces BG.12
[III]. What do we mean by classiﬁcations and characterizations?
• By classiﬁcation, we mean that given certain physics theories or phenomena (here, higher-iTQFT and
higher quantum anomalies), given a spacetime dimensions (here d + 1d for higher-iTQFT or dd for
higher quantum anomalies), and their spacetime Gspacetime-structure and the internal higher global
symmetry Ginternal, we compute how many classes (a number to count them) there are? Also, we
aim to determine the mathematical structures of classes (i.e. here group structure as for (co)bordism
groups: would the classes be a ﬁnite group ZN or an inﬁnite group Z or others, etc.).
10We abbreviate both Symmetry-Protected Topological state and Symmetry-Protected Topological states as SPTs.
We also abbreviate both Symmetry-Enriched Topologically ordered state and Symmetry-Enriched Topologically ordered
states as SETs.
11For example, the interacting versions of 10 Cartan symmetry classes of fermionic superconductors/insulators classi-
ﬁcations (e.g. [47] in 4d or 3+1D) from condensed matter can be captured precisely by bordism invariants as invertible
TQFTs [35].
12Although most of our results in this article focus on the ordinary symmetry group, our framework does allow us to
consider possible higher symmetries and higher anomalies [31,34].

• By characterization, we mean that we formulate their mathematical invariants (here, we mean the
bordism invariants) to fully describe or capture their mathematical essences and physics properties.
Hopefully, one may further compute their physical observables from mathematical invariants.
Since some of readers are still with us reading this sentence (after we answer the three questions [I],
[II] and [III]), we believe that these readers decide to be interested in understanding our results in details.
Here we concern theories of 4d SMs, GUTs and BSMs and their anomalies and topological terms. Their
4d ’t Hooft anomalies captured by 5d iTQFTs. These 5d iTQFTs or bordism invariants are deﬁned on
the dd manifolds (d = 5). In fact, in our work, we present all
(d −1)d ’t Hooft anomalies captured by dd iTQFTs, for d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
associated with various SMs, GUTs and BSM (ungauged) symmetries. The manifold generators for the
bordism groups are actually the closed dd manifolds. We should clarify that although there are ’t Hooft
anomalies for (d−1)d QFTs (so Ginternal may not be gauge-able on the boundary), the SPTs/topological
invariants deﬁned in the closed dd actually have Ginternal always gauge-able in that dd. This is related
to the fact that the bulk dd SPTs in condensed matter physics has an onsite local internal Ginternal-
symmetry (or on-n-simplex-symmetry as a generalization for higher-SPTs), thus this Ginternal must be
gauge-able. By gauging the topological terms, this idea has been used to study the vacua of YM gauge
theories coupling to dynamically gauged SPT terms (like the orbifold techniques in string theory, but
here we generalize this thinking to any dimension), for example, in [35] and references therein. There
are other uses and interpretations of our cobordism theory data that we will explain in Sec. 8.
We should emphasize that several recent pursuits are also along the fusions between the non-
perturbative physics of SMs, GUTs, and BSMs via a cobordism theory:
• Garcia-Etxebarria-Montero [50] studies global anomalies of some SMs and GUTs model via a
Dai-Freed theorem and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) [25].
• Wang-Wen [51], independently, studies the non-perturbative deﬁnitions (e.g. on a lattice) and the
global anomalies of SO(10) GUTs or SO(18) GUTs via Ω

a Z2 class (or a mod 2 class) global anomaly captured by the 5d iTQFT:

M5 w2(TM)w3(TM),

where wj(TM) is the j-th-Stiefel-Whitney class for the tangent bundle of 5D spacetime M5. We

connection — a mixed gravity-gauge connection,
rather than the pure gravitational Spin(d = 5) connection, such that w2(TM) = w2(VSO(n)) ≡
w2(SO(n)) and w3(TM) = w3(VSO(n)) ≡w3(SO(n)), where wj(VSO(n)) := wj(SO(n)) is the j-th-
Stiefel-Whitney class for the associated vector bundle of an SO(n) gauge bundle. The M5 can be
a non-spin manifold. This is the same global anomaly known as “a new SU(2) anomaly” studied
in Ref. [15]. But Ref. [51] and [15] show explicitly, since
Spin(10) ⊃Spin(3) = SU(2),
13Before dynamically gauging Spin(10), SO(10)-GUT is one kind of such theory: an Spin(10)-chiral gauge theory with
fermions in the half-integer (iso)spin-representation. So we may call this ungauged theory as SO(10)-GUT chiral fermion
theory.
10
if the SO(10) GUT chiral fermion theory is free from “the new SU(2) anomaly [15]” (which indeed
is true), then the SO(10) GUT chiral fermion theory contains no anomaly at all. Thus this SO(10)
GUT is all anomaly-free [15,51].” This leads to a possible non-perturbative construction of SO(10)
GUTs on the lattice proposed in [52,53], rooted in the idea of gapping the mirror chiral fermions of
Eichten-Preskill [54]. However, we will not pursue this idea of [51] nor [52,53] (such as the lattice
regularization) further in this work, but leave this for a future exploration [55].14
• Wan-Wang [31–34] attempts to classify all invertible local or global anomalies and the invertible
higher-anomalies, based on a generalized cobordism group classiﬁcation of invertible TQFTs and
invertible higher-TQFTs in one higher dimensions via Adams spectral sequence. Ref. [31] computes
the cobordism classiﬁcation relevant for perturbative anomalies of chiral fermions (e.g. originated
from Adler-Bell-Jackiw [9,10]) or chiral bosons with U(1) symmetry in any even spacetime dimen-
sions; they also compute the cobordism classiﬁcation for the non-perturbative global anomalies
such as Witten anomaly [14] and the new SU(2) anomaly [15] in 4d and 5d. Ref. [31] also obtains
the cobordism classiﬁcation relevant for higher ’t Hooft anomalies for a pure 4d SU(N) YM theory
with a second-Chern-class θ = π topological term [16–18].
• McNamara-Vafa [61] studies the cobordism classes and the constraints on the Quantum Gravity
or String Theory Landscape v.s. Swampland. QFT must satisfy some consistent criteria in order
to be part of a consistent theory of Quantum Gravity. Those QFT not obeying those criteria are
quoted to reside in Swampland.
• Davighi-Gripaios-Lohitsiri [62] studies also the global anomalies in various SMs and BSMs, based
on Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
• Kaidi-Parra-Martinez-Tachikawa [63, 64] studies the possible fermionic SPTs (or invertible spin
TQFTs) on the worldsheet of the string as the Gliozzi-Scherk-Olive (GSO) projections in the
superstring theory. Their approach, based on the various relevant bordism groups, also shows the
relationship to the K-theoretic classiﬁcation of D-branes.
• Freed-Hopkins [65] studies a global anomaly cancellation involving the time-reversal symmetry
relevant for the 11-dimensional M theory.
The outline of our article is the following.
We consider the following models/theories, their
co/bordism groups, TP groups, topological terms and anomalies, written in terms of iTQFTs.

Ref. [56–58] based on the anomaly cancellation constraints, or in 3+1d based on arguments about the topological defects
in Ref. [59,60].

Deﬁnition of bordism groups
Figure 1: Bordism between manifolds. Here M and M′ are two closed d-manifolds, N is a compact
d + 1-manifold whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and M′, so ∂N = M ⊔M′. If there are
additional G-structures on these manifolds, then the G-structure on N is required to be compatible with
the G-structures on M and M′. If there are additional maps from these manifolds to a ﬁxed topological
space, then the maps are also required to be compatible with each other. If these conditions are satisﬁed,
then M and M′ are called bordant and N is called a bordism between M and M′. This relation is an
equivalence relation.
We assume that the readers are familiar with the basic algebraic topology, such as (co)homology and
homotopy. To ﬁll in the gap between this knowledge and the mathematical tools used in this article, we
introduce some prerequisites in this subsection.
15More generally, the global structure of gauge group as G or G/Γ makes the real physical diﬀerences in observables
(see [67] and [66]).
12
First, we introduce the notion of bordism group. To deﬁne the bordism group, we need to deﬁne a
tangential structure which involves the notion of classifying spaces.
For any Lie group G, the BG is the
classifying space of principal G-bundles, namely the homotopy classes of maps X →BG are in one-to-one
correspondence with the isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles over X for any topological space
X. For any abelian group G, the iterated classifying space B2G is also the Eilenberg-MacLane space
K(G, 2). For any abelian group G, more generally, we have the BdG = K(G, d).
To deﬁne tangential structure, we require the orthogonal group O(n) since a tangential structure
involves a ﬁbration over the classifying space of O(n). There is a natural inclusion O(n) →O(n + 1).
Let O denote the colimit O := colimn→∞O(n). The inclusions Rq →Rq+1 induce the closed inclusions
of Grassmannian spaces Grn(Rq) →Grn(Rq+1). The colimit colimq→∞Grn(Rq) is the classifying space
BO(n). There are closed inclusions Grn(Rq) →Grn+1(Rq+1) obtained by sending W 7→R ⊕W where
we write Rq+1 = R ⊕Rq. These induce maps BO(n) →BO(n + 1), and we deﬁne
BO := colimn→∞BO(n).
(1.9)
The BO is a classifying space for the inﬁnite orthogonal group O.
An n-dimensional tangential structure is a topological space BG(n) and a ﬁbration π(n) : BG(n) →
BO(n). A stable tangential structure is a topological space BG and a ﬁbration π : BG →BO. It gives
rise to an n-dimensional tangential structure for each n ∈Z≥0 by letting π(n) : BG(n) →BO(n) be the
ﬁber product (also called pullback)
BG(n)
/
π(n)

BG
π

BO(n)
/ BO.
(1.10)
Here the map BO(n) →BO is the inclusion map. If M is an m-dimensional manifold, then a G(n)-
structure on M is a lift M →BG(n) of a classifying map M →BO(n) of g
TM, where we have stabilized
the tangent bundle TM of the m-dimensional manifold M to the rank n bundle
g
TM := Rn−m ⊕TM.
(1.11)
Here Rn−m is the trivial real vector bundle of dimension n −m.
A G-structure on M is a family
of coherent G(n)-structures for n suﬃciently large.
Here coherent G(n)-structures for n suﬃciently
large means that the composite of the G(l)-structure on M and the inclusion map BG(l) →BG(n):
M →BG(l) →BG(n) is exactly the G(n)-structure on M for l < n where l and n are suﬃciently large.
Notice that an n-dimensional tangential structure induces an l-dimensional tangential structure for all
l < n by taking the ﬁber product (also called pullback)

(1.12)
See [69] for more details.
For any structure group G and any topological space X, we deﬁne the bordism group as the set of
equivalence classes:
ΩG
d (X) := {(M, f) | M is a closed d-manifold with a G-structure, f : M →X is a map}/ ∼. (1.13)
13
The (M, f) is a pair of data of the manifold M and map f. The ∼is an equivalence relation deﬁned
on the set of pairs of a manifold M and a map f. (M, f) ∼(M′, f′) if and only if there is a compact
(d+1)-manifold N with a G-structure and a map F : N →X such that the boundary of N is the disjoint
union of M and M′ (Figure 1), the G-structures on M and M′ are induced from the G-structure on N,
and F|M = f and F|M′ = f′. The disjoint union operation on closed d-manifolds induces an abelian
group structure on ΩG
d (X). Here a G-structure on a manifold is a G-structure on the stable tangent
bundle of this manifold. In this article, we will focus on the case when X is a classifying space. In most
cases, X is just a point.
If ΩG
d (X) = G1 × G2 × · · · × Gr where Gi are cyclic groups, then the group homomorphisms ϕi :
ΩG
d (X) →Gi are called bordism invariants, and they form a complete set of bordism invariants if
ϕ = (ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕr) : ΩG
d (X) →G1 × G2 × · · · × Gr is a group isomorphism. So (M, f) and (M′, f′)
are in the same equivalence class of the bordism group ΩG
d (X) if and only if the values of each bordism
invariant ϕi on (M, f) and (M′, f′) are the same for 1 ≤i ≤r.
In this article, we will compute the bordism groups ΩG
d for G = Spin × G′ or Spin ×Z2 G′ for some
groups G′. So we ﬁrst clarify these notations here. Spin (or Spin(d)) is a nontrivial extension of the
group SO (or SO(d)) by Z2, namely there are short exact sequences of groups
1 →Z2 →Spin →SO →1,
(1.14)
1 →Z2 →Spin(d) →SO(d) →1,
(1.15)
where SO is the colimit of SO(d), and SO(d) is the special orthogonal group. The Spin is the colimit of
Spin(d). The Spin ×Z2 G′ is the quotient group of Spin × G′ by the diagonal central subgroup Z2.
1.2.2
Spectra
For a pointed topological space X, the Σ denotes a suspension ΣX = S1 ∧X = (S1 × X)/(S1 ∨X)
where ∧and ∨are smash product and wedge sum (a one point union) of pointed topological spaces
respectively.
Now we recall some basic notions regarding spectrum, see [31,69] for more details.
A prespectrum
T• is a sequence {Tn}n∈Z≥0 of pointed spaces and the maps sn : ΣTn →Tn+1.
An Ω-prespectrum
is a prespectrum T• such that the adjoints tq : Tn →ΩTn+1 of the structure maps are weak homotopy
equivalences.
Here Ωmeans the loop space, its meaning is diﬀerent from the bordism notation Ω.
A spectrum is a prespectrum T• such that the adjoints tn : Tn →ΩTn+1 of the structure maps are
homeomorphisms.
For example, let X be a pointed space, Tn = ΣnX for n ≥0, then T• is a prespectrum.
In particular, if Tn = Sn, then T• is a prespectrum. Let G be an abelian group, Tn = K(G, n) be the
Eilenberg-MacLane space, then T• is an Ω-prespectrum. In general, these examples are not spectra. But
we can always construct a spectrum from a prespectrum using spectriﬁcation.
Let T• be a prespectrum, deﬁne (LT)n to be the colimit of
Tn

Ωltn+l
−−−−→. . . .
Namely,
(LT)n = coliml→∞ΩlTn+l,
14
then (LT)• is a spectrum, called the spectriﬁcation of T•.
For example, if Tn = Sn, then (LT)• is a
spectrum S (the sphere spectrum). Let G be an abelian group, Tq = K(G, n) the Eilenberg-MacLane
space, then (LT)• is a spectrum HG (the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum).
Next we deﬁne the homotopy groups and cohomology rings of prespectra. Let T• be a prespectrum,
we deﬁne the (stable) homotopy group πdT• to be the colimit of
πd+nTn
πd+ntn
−−−−→πd+nΩTn+1
adjunction
−−−−−−→πd+n+1Tn+1 . . . .
Namely,
πdT• = colimn→∞πd+nTn.
If M• and N• are two prespectra, and N• is an Ω-prespectrum, then for any integer k, the abelian
group of homotopy classes of maps from M• to N• of degree −k is deﬁned as follows: a map from M• to
N• of degree −k is a sequence of maps Mn →Nn+k such that the following diagram commutes
ΣMn
/

ΣNn+k

Mn+1
/ Nn+k+1
(1.16)
where the columns are the structure maps of the prespectra M• and N•. Two maps of prespectra of
degree −k: f, g : M• →N•+k are homotopic, denoted f ≃g, if there is a map H : M• ∧I+ →N•+k
which restricts to f ∨g along the inclusion M• ∨M•
i0∨i1
−−−→M• ∧I+
H
−→N•+k where the interval I = [0, 1],
I+ is the disjoint union of I and a base point. Here i0 and i1 are the inclusion maps at 0 ∈I and 1 ∈I
respectively. Note that Σ(M• × I) ̸= ΣM• × I, so we use M ∧I+ instead of M• × I. The [M•, N•]−k is
an abelian group since N• is an Ω-prespectrum. If in addition, N• is a ring spectrum, then the abelian
groups [M•, N•]−k form a graded ring [M•, N•]−∗. In particular, [M•, N•] := [M•, N•]0. For example,
πdM• = [S, M•]d. Let R be a ring, then the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HR is a ring spectrum. The
cohomology ring of a prespectrum M• with coeﬃcients in R is deﬁned to be H∗(M•, R) := [M•, HR]−∗.
Let V →Y be a real vector bundle, and ﬁx a Euclidean metric. The Thom space Thom(Y ; V ) is the
quotient D(V )/S(V ) where D(V ) is the unit disk bundle and S(V ) is the unit sphere bundle. Namely,
D(V ) = {v ∈V | |v| ≤1} and S(V ) = {v ∈V | |v| = 1} where | · | denotes the Euclidean norm.
Thom spaces satisfy
Thom(X × Y ; V × W)

Thom(X; Rn)
=
ΣnX+,
(1.17)
where V →X and W →Y are real vector bundles, Rn is the trivial real vector bundle of dimension n,
and X+ is the disjoint union of X and a point.
Let G be a group with a group homomorphism ρ : G →O. Let MG(n) = Thom(BG(n); Vn), where
Vn is the induced vector bundle (of dimension n) by the map BG(n) →BO(n). Let Tn = MG(n), then
T• is a prespectrum by the property of Thom spaces. The Thom spectrum MG is the spectriﬁcation of
T•. In other words, MG = Thom(BG; V ) where V is the colimit of Vn −n.
15
Let G be a group with a group homomorphism ρ : G →O. The Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG
is the colimit of ΣnMTG(n), where the virtual Thom spectrum MTG(n) = Thom(BG(n); −Vn) is the

and there is a direct sum Rn+q = Vn ⊕Qq of vector bundles over Grn(Rn+q) and, by pullback, over
BG(n, n + q) where Rn+q is the trivial real vector bundle of dimension n + q. In other words, MTG =
Thom(BG; −V ) where V is the colimit of Vn −n.
1.2.3
Adams spectral sequence
Adams spectral sequence is a mathematical tool to compute the homotopy groups of spectra [70]. In
particular, the homotopy group of the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG [39] is the bordism group
ΩG
d . We use Adams spectral sequence to compute several bordism groups related to Standard Models
(SM), Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT) and beyond. We also compute the group TPd(G) classifying the
topological phases (i.e., the topological terms in QFT or the topological phases of quantum matter)
based on the computation of bordism groups and a short exact sequence. See [19, 31, 35] for primers.
We will call the group TPd(G) the cobordism group. The relation between ΩG
d and TPd(G) is like that
between homology group and cohomology group, as we will see later.
The Adams spectral sequence shows [70]:
Exts,t
Ap(H∗(Y, Zp), Zp) ⇒(πt−s(Y ))∧
p ,
(1.19)
where the Ext denotes the extension functor. Note that this extension functor has 2 upper indices. It is
diﬀerent from but similar to the usual extension functor. The index s refers to the degree of resolution,
and the index t is the internal degree of the graded module.
Here Ap = [HZp, HZp]−∗is the mod
p Steenrod algebra which consists of mod p cohomology operations [71], and Y is any spectrum. In
particular, the mod 2 Steenrod algebra A2 is generated by the Steenrod squares Sqi : H∗(−, Z2) →
H∗+i(−, Z2). By the Yoneda lemma, the H∗(Y, Zp) = [Y, HZp]−∗is automatically an Ap-module whose
internal degree t is given by the ∗. The (πt−s(Y ))∧
p is the p-completion of the (t −s)-th homotopy group
of the spectrum Y . For any ﬁnitely generated abelian group G, the abelian group G∧
p = limn→∞G/pnG is
the p-completion of G. We note that, if G is a ﬁnite abelian group, then the G∧
p is the Sylow p-subgroup
of G; if G is the inﬁnite cyclic group Z, then the G∧
p is the ring of p-adic integers. Here the G is meant
to be substituted by a homotopy group πt−s(Y ) in (1.19). Here are some explanations and inputs:
(1). Here the double-arrow “⇒” means “convergent to.” The E2 page are groups Exts,t with double indices
(s, t), we reindex the bidegree by (t −s, s). Inductively, there are diﬀerentials dr in Er page which are
arrows from (t −s, s) to (t −s −1, s + r) (that is, Exts,t →Exts+r,t+r−1). Take Kerdr/Imdr at each
(t −s, s), then we get the Er+1 page. Finally Er page equals Er+1 page (there are no diﬀerentials) for
r ≥N, we call this EN page as the E∞page, we can read the result πd at t −s = d. See further details
discussed in Ref. [31]’s Sec. 2.3.

Figure 2: The Er page of Adams spectral sequence
(2). In Adams spectral sequence, we consider Exts,t
R (L, Zp). In this article, we will consider the algebra
R = Ap or A2(1) for p = 2, and L is an R-module. The A2(1) is the subalgebra of A2 generated by the
Steenrod squares Sq1 and Sq2. Ext groups are deﬁned by ﬁrstly taking a projective R-resolution P•
of L, then secondly computing the (co)homology group of the (co)chain complex Hom(P•, Zp). Here a
projective R-resolution P• is an exact sequence of R-modules · · · →Ps →Ps−1 →· · · →P0 →L where
Ps is a projective R-module for s ≥0. An R-module is projective if and only if it is a direct summand
of a free R-module.
For Y = MTG, where MTG is the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum of a group G, the Adams spectral
sequence (1.19) shows:
Exts,t
Ap(H∗(MTG, Zp), Zp) ⇒πt−s(MTG)∧
p = (ΩG
d=t−s)∧
p .
(1.20)
The last equality is by the generalized Pontryagin-Thom isomorphism, we have an equality between the
d-th bordism group of G given by ΩG
d and the d-th homotopy group of MTG given by πd(MTG), namely
ΩG
d = πd(MTG).
(1.21)
The T in MTG means that the G-structures are on the stable tangent bundles instead of stable nor-
mal bundles. For Spin, the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTSpin = MSpin is equivalent to the Thom
spectrum.
We also compute the cobordism group of topological phases (TP) deﬁned in [19] as
TPd(G) := [MTG, Σd+1IZ].
(1.22)
Here IZ is the Anderson dual spectrum. By [19], the torsion part of TPd(G) classiﬁes deformation
classes of reﬂection positive invertible d-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theories with a symmetry
group G(d). Here G(d) means the d-dimensional spacetime version of the group G. The TPd(G) and
the bordism group ΩG
d are related by a short exact sequence
0 →Ext1(ΩG
d , Z) →TPd(G) →Hom(ΩG
d+1, Z) →0.
(1.23)
This short exact sequence is very similar to the universal coeﬃcient theorem relating homology group
and cohomology group. It is split, since Ext1(ΩG
d , Z) is always torsion, Hom(ΩG
d+1, Z) is always free, and
Ext1(Z, Zn) = 0. So we can directly derive the group TPd(G) from the data of ΩG
d and ΩG
d+1.
We will use the (1.20) and (1.21) to compute the d-th bordism group of G given by ΩG
d . Then we
will use (1.23) to compute the d-th cobordism group of topological phases of G given by TPd(G).
17
If G = Spin × G′, then BG = BSpin × BG′. By deﬁnition, the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG =
Thom(BG; −V ) where V is the induced virtual bundle of dimension 0 by the map BG →BO. By the
properties of Thom space (1.17), we have
MT(Spin × G′) = MSpin ∧(BG′)+.
(1.24)
The ∧is the smash product.16 The (BG′)+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space BG′ and a point.17
By the generalized Pontryagin-Thom isomorphism, for any structure group G and any topological space
X, we have
ΩG
d (X) = πd(MTG ∧X+).
(1.25)
Since MTSpin = MSpin, we have
ΩSpin×G′
d
= πd(MT(Spin × G′)) = πd(MSpin ∧(BG′)+) = ΩSpin
d
(BG′).
(1.26)
If MTG = MSpin ∧X where X is any topological space, by Corollary 5.1.2 of [72] which is based
on [73], we have
Exts,t
A2(H∗(MSpin ∧X, Z2), Z2) = Exts,t
A2(1)(H∗(X, Z2), Z2)
(1.27)
for t −s < 8. Here A2(1) is the subalgebra of A2 generated by Sq1 and Sq2.
So for the dimension d = t −s < 8, we have
Exts,t
A2(1)(H∗(X, Z2), Z2) ⇒(ΩG
t−s)∧
2 .
(1.28)
The reduced cohomology H∗(X, Z2) is an A2(1)-module whose internal degree t is given by the ∗.
Lemma 1 (Lemma 11 of [31]). Given a short exact sequence of A2(1)-modules
0 →L1 →L2 →L3 →0,
(1.29)
then for any t, there is a long exact sequence
· · · →Exts,t
A2(1)(L3, Z2) →Exts,t
A2(1)(L2, Z2) →Exts,t
A2(1)(L1, Z2)
(1.30)
d1
→Exts+1,t
A2(1)(L3, Z2) →Exts+1,t
A2(1)(L2, Z2) →· · ·
We can compute the E2 page of A2(1)-module based on Lemma 1.
More precisely, in order to
compute Exts,t
A2(1)(L2, Z2), we ﬁnd a short exact sequence of A2(1)-modules
0 →L1 →L2 →L3 →0,
(1.31)
then we apply Lemma 1 to compute Exts,t
A2(1)(L2, Z2) by the given data of Exts,t
A2(1)(L1, Z2) and
Exts,t
A2(1)(L3, Z2).
Our strategy is choosing L1 to be the direct sum of suspensions of Z2 on which
Sq1 and Sq2 act trivially, then we take L3 to be the quotient of L2 by L1. If Exts,t
A2(1)(L3, Z2) is undeter-
mined, then we take L3 to be the new L2 and repeat this procedure. We can use this procedure again
and again until Exts,t
A2(1)(L2, Z2) is determined.
16Smash product between a spectrum M• and a topological space X is a spectrum whose n-th space is Mn ∧X which is
the ordinary smash product of topological spaces.
17For a topological space X, it is a standard convention to denote that X+ as the disjoint union of X and a point. Note
that the reduced cohomology of X+ is exactly the ordinary cohomology of X.

1.2.4
Characteristic classes
Throughout the article, we use the standard notation for characteristic classes: wi for the Stiefel-Whitney
class, ci for the Chern class, pi for the Pontryagin class, and en for the Euler class. Note that the Euler
class only appears in the total dimension of the vector bundle. We use the notation wi(G), ci(G), pi(G),
and en(G) to denote the characteristic classes of the associated vector bundle of the principal G bundle
(normally denoted as wi(VG), ci(VG), pi(VG), and en(VG)). For simplicity, we may denote the Stiefel-
Whitney class of the tangent bundle TM as wj ≡wj(TM); if we do not specify wj with which bundle,
then we really mean TM.
We will use CSV
2n−1 to denote the Chern-Simons 2n −1-form for the Chern class (if V is a complex
vector bundle) or the Pontryagin class (if V is a real vector bundle). Note that pi(V ) = (−1)ic2i(V ⊗C).
The relation between the Chern-Simons form and the Chern class is
cn(V ) = dCSV
2n−1
(1.32)
where the d is the exterior diﬀerential and the cn(V ) is regarded as a closed diﬀerential form in de Rham
cohomology.
There is also another kind of Chern-Simons form for Euler class e2n(V ) [74], we denote it by CSV
2n−1,e,
it satisﬁes
e2n(V ) = dCSV
2n−1,e.
(1.33)
The relations between Pontryagin class, Euler class and Stiefel-Whitney class are
pi(V ) = w2i(V )2
mod 2
(1.34)
and
e2n(V ) = w2n(V )
mod 2
(1.35)
where 2n = dim V .
By the Hirzebruch signature theorem, the relation between the signature and the ﬁrst Pontryagin
class of a 4-manifold M is

Lie algebra to Lie group and the representation theory
To justify the spacetime symmetry group Gspacetime and internal symmetry group Ginternal relevant for
Standard Model physics, we shall ﬁrst review the Lie algebra of Standard Models, to the representation
theory of matter ﬁeld contents, and to the Lie groups of Standard Models.
[I]. The local gauge structure of Standard Model is given by the Lie algebra u(1) × su(2) × su(3). This means
that the Lie algebra valued 1-form gauge ﬁelds take values in u(1)×su(2)×su(3). The 1-form gauge ﬁelds
are the 1-connections of the principals Ginternal-bundles that we should determine.
19
[II]. Fermions as the spinor ﬁelds. A spinor ﬁeld is a section of the spinor bundle. For the left-handed Weyl
spinor ΨL, it is a doublet spin-1/2 representation of spacetime symmetry group Gspacetime (Minkowski
Spin(3, 1) or Euclidean Spin(4)), denoted as
ΨL ∼2L of Spin(3, 1), or ΨL ∼2L of Spin(4).
(1.37)
On the other hand, the matter ﬁelds as Weyl spinors ΨL contain:
• The left-handed up and down quarks (u and d) form a doublet
u
d

L
in 2 for the SU(2)weak, and they
are in 3 for the SU(3)strong.
• The right-handed up and down quarks, each forms a singlet uR and dR in 1 for the SU(2)weak. They
are in 3 for the SU(3)strong.
• The left-handed electron and neutrino form a doublet
νe
e

L
in 2 for the SU(2)weak, and they are in
1 for the SU(3)strong.
• The right-handed electron forms a singlet in 1 for the SU(2)weak, and it is in 1 for the SU(3)strong.
There are two more families of quarks: charm and strange quarks (c and s), and top and bottom quarks
(t and b). There are also two more families of leptons: muon and its neutrino (µ and νµ), and tauon and
its neutrino (τ and ντ). So there are three families (i.e., generations) of quarks and leptons:
 u
d

νe

× 3 families.(1.41)
In fact, all the following four kinds of
Ginternal = SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Zq
(1.42)
with q = 1, 2, 3, 6 are compatible with the above representations of fermion ﬁelds. These Weyl spinors can
be written in the following more succinct forms of representations for any of the internal symmetry group
Ginternal with q = 1, 2, 3, 6:
 
(3, 2, 1/6)L, (3, 1, 2/3)R, (3, 1, −1/3)R, (1, 2, −1/2)L, (1, 1, −1)R
!
× 3 families
⇒
 
(3, 2, 1/6)L, (3, 1, −2/3)L, (3, 1, 1/3)L, (1, 2, −1/2)L, (1, 1, 1)L
!
× 3 families.
(1.43)
20
The triplet given above is listed by their (SU(3) representation, SU(2) representation, hypercharge Y ).18
For example, (3, 2, 1/6) means that 3 in SU(3), 2 in SU(2) and 1/6 for hypercharge. In the second line, we
transforms the right-handed Weyl spinor ΨR ∼2R of Spin(3, 1) to its left-handed ΨL ∼2L of Spin(3, 1),
while we ﬂip their (SU(3) representation, SU(2) representation, hypercharge) to its (complex) conjugation
representations.19 If we include the right-handed neutrinos (say νeR, νµR, and ντ R), they are all in the
representation (1, 1, 0)R with no hypercharge. We can also represent a right-handed neutrino by the left-
handed (complex) conjugation version (1, 1, 0)L.
Also the complex scalar Higgs ﬁeld φH is in a representation (1, 2, 1/2).20 In the Higgs condensed phase,
the conventional Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) is chosen to be ⟨φH⟩=
1
√
2
0
v

, which vev has
QEM = 0.
[III]. If we include the 3×2+3+3+2+1 = 15 left-handed Weyl spinors from one single family, we can combine
them as a multiplet of 5 and 10 left-handed Weyl spinors of SU(5):
(3, 1, 1/3)L ⊕(1, 2, −1/2)L
∼
5 of SU(5),
(1.45)
(3, 2, 1/6)L ⊕(3, 1, −2/3)L ⊕(1, 1, 1)L
∼
10 of SU(5).
(1.46)
Hence we can study the SU(5) GUT with a SU(5) gauge group.
[IV]. If we include the 3 × 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 left-handed Weyl spinors from one single family, and also a
right-handed neutrino, we can combine them as a multiplet of 16 left-handed Weyl spinors:
ΨL ∼16+ of Spin(10),
(1.47)
which sits at the 16-dimensional irreducible spinor representation of Spin(10). (There are 16+ and 16−-
dimensional irreducible spinor representation together form a 32-dimensional reducible spinor representa-
tion of Spin(10).) Namely, we should study the SO(10) GUT with a Spin(10) gauge group instead of a
SO(10) gauge group.
[V]. We ﬁnd the following Lie group embedding for the internal symmetry of GUTs and Standard Models:
SO(10) ⊃SU(5) ⊃U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3)
Z6
.
(1.48)
Spin(10) ⊃SU(5) ⊃U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3)
Z6
.
(1.49)
The other Zq for q = 1, 2, 3 cannot be embedded into Spin(10) nor SU(5). So from the GUT perspective,
it is natural to consider the Standard Model gauge group U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
Z6
.
18Note that the hypercharge Y is conventionally given by the relation: QEM = T3 + Y where QEM is the unbroken (un-
Higgsed) electromagnetic gauge charge and T3 = 1

is a generator of SU(2)weak. However, some other conventions
are possible, one convention is QEM = T3 + 1
2Y ′, another convention is QEM = T3 + 1
6 ˜Y [66]. In the QEM = T3 + 1
6 ˜Y version,
we have the integer quantized ˜Y = 6Y . We can rewrite (1.43) as:
 
(3, 2, ˜Y = 1)L, (3, 1, ˜Y = 4)R, (3, 1, ˜Y = −2)R, (1, 2, ˜Y = −3)L, (1, 1, ˜Y = −6)R
!
× 3 families
⇒
 
(3, 2, ˜Y = 1)L, (3, 1, ˜Y = −4)L, (3, 1, ˜Y = 2)L, (1, 2, ˜Y = −3)L, (1, 1, ˜Y = 6)L
!
× 3 families.
(1.44)
Then the right-handed neutrino stays the same form since ˜Y = 3Y ′ = 6Y = 0.
19Note that 2 and 2 are the same representation in SU(2), see, e.g., [35].
20The Higgs ﬁeld φH is in (1, 2, Y = 1/2) = (1, 2, Y ′ = 1) = (1, 2, ˜Y = 3) where ˜Y = 3Y ′ = 6Y .
21
[VI]. We ﬁnd the following group embedding for the spacetime and internal symmetries of GUTs and Standard
Models (see also [34] for the derivations):
Spin(d) × Spin(10)

⊃Spin(d) × SU(5) ⊃Spin(d) × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)

(1.51)
We shall study the cobordism theory of these SM, BSM, and GUT groups in the following subsections.

Standard Models
Now we consider the co/bordism classes relevant for Standard Model (SM) physics [3–5].
2.1
Spin × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) model
We consider G = Spin × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G
is
MTG = MSpin ∧(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)))+.
(2.1)
The (B(SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space B(SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1))
and a point, see footnote 17.
For the dimension d = t −s < 8, since there is no odd torsion,21 for MTG = MSpin ∧(B(SU(3) ×
SU(2) × U(1)))+, for the dimension d = t −s < 8, by (1.28), we have the Adams spectral sequence
Exts,t
A2(1)(H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)), Z2), Z2) ⇒ΩSpin×SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)

(2.2)
We have
H∗(BSU(n), Z2) = Z2[c2, . . . , cn]
(2.3)
and
H∗(BU(n), Z2) = Z2[c1, . . . , cn].
(2.4)
We also have the Wu formula22
Sq2j(ci) =

i −k −1

ci+j−kck for 0 ≤j ≤i.
(2.6)
21By computation using the mod p Adams spectral sequence for an odd prime p, we ﬁnd there is no odd torsion.
22There is another Wu formula which will be used later:
Sqi(xd−i) = uixd−i
(2.5)
on d-manifold M where xd−i ∈Hd−i(M, Z2) and ui is the Wu class.
22
By K¨unneth formula, we have
H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)), Z2) = Z2[c2, c3] ⊗Z2[c′
2] ⊗Z2[c′′
1].
(2.7)
Here only in this subsection, ci is the Chern class of SU(3) bundle, and c′
i is the Chern class of SU(2)
bundle, and c′′
i is the Chern class of U(1) bundle.
The A2(1)-module structure of H∗(B(SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)), Z2) below degree 6 and the E2 page are
shown in Figure 3, 4. Here we have used the correspondence between A2(1)-module structure and the

To read the result from the Adams chart in Figure 4, we look at the stabilized E∞page, one

group Zpn.
But when n = ∞, the inﬁnite line connecting inﬁnite dots indicates a Z.
Here p is

The localization of MSpin at the prime 3 is the wedge sum of suspensions of the Brown-Peterson

two-sided ideal generated by β(3,3), and β(3,3) is the Bockstein homomorphism associated to the extension

Spin × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
model
We consider G = Spin × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
= Spin × S(U(3) × U(2)).
This SM group is particularly
interesting because:
Spin(10) ⊃SU(5) ⊃SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
, and SO(10) ⊃SU(5) ⊃SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
.
(2.17)
Thus the SO(10) GUT and SO(5) GUT can be Higgs down to SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
SM. We have
(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1))/Z6 = (SU(3) × U(2))/Z3 = (SU(2) × U(3))/Z2.
(2.18)
Let the hypercharge be:
Y ≡Y ′
2 ≡
˜Y
6 ≡diag(−1
3, −1
3, −1
3, 1
2, 1
2).
(2.19)
The group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
is just the subgroup of SU(5) commuting with the group generated by Y .
The subgroup is S(U(3) × U(2)) = (A, B) ∈U(3) × U(2)| det A · det B = 1 and (SU(3) × SU(2) ×
U(1))/Z6 = S(U(3) × U(2)) ⊂SU(5).
Since
H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
), Z3) = H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z3
), Z3),
(2.20)
similarly as the discussion in Sec. 2.3, there is no 3-torsion in ΩSpin×S(U(3)×U(2))
d
.
The Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G is
MTG = MSpin ∧(B(S(U(3) × U(2))))+.
(2.21)
The (B(S(U(3) × U(2))))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space B(S(U(3) × U(2))) and a point,
see footnote 17.
For the dimension d = t −s < 8, since there is no odd torsion (see footnote 21), by (1.28), we have
the Adams spectral sequence
Exts,t
A2(1)(H∗(B(S(U(3) × U(2))), Z2), Z2) ⇒ΩSpin×S(U(3)×U(2))

So by K¨unneth formula, we have

2]/(c1 = c′

theorem, (σ−F·F

Here c1(U(3)) is identiﬁed with c1(U(2)).
Note that
c1(U(3))2 = Sq2c1(U(3)) = (w2 + w2

Comparison between Adams spectral sequence and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence
• Our approach [31, 34] is based on Adams spectral sequence (ASS), which includes the more reﬁned
data, containing both module and group structure, thus with the beneﬁts of having less diﬀerentials. In
addition, as another advantage, we can conveniently read and extract the iTQFT (namely, co/bordism
invariants) from the Adams chart and ASS [31,34].
• Ref. [50, 62] is based on Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS), which includes only the group
structure, but with the disadvantage of having more diﬀerentials and some undetermined extensions. It
is also not known or diﬃcult, if not impossible, to extract the iTQFT data directly (namely, co/bordism
invariants) from the AHSS. Therefore, Ref. [50, 62] cannot provide the explicit iTQFT data from the
AHSS calculations.
By (1.26) and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
Hp(X, ΩSpin
q
) ⇒ΩSpin
p+q (X),
(2.25)
one can compute the bordism groups ΩSpin
d
(BG′) = ΩSpin×G′
d
. However, in general, one can not com-
pute the bordism groups Ω
Spin×Z2G′
d
using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence since by (1.21),
Ω
Spin×Z2G′
d
= πd(MT(Spin ×Z2 G′)) = πd(MSpin ∧X′) for some topological space X′, but X′ is not
the disjoint union of a topological space X and a point, while by (1.25), ΩSpin
d
(X) = πd(MSpin ∧X+)
where X+ is the disjoint union of X and a point.
In contrast, in this article, using Adams spectral sequence, we compute the bordism groups Ω
Spin×Z2G′
d
for several groups G′, such as G′ = SU(4) × SU(2) × SU(2) or SU(4) ×Z2 (SU(2) × SU(2)) in the
Pati-Salam models, and G′ = Spin(10) or Spin(18) in the Grand Uniﬁed Theories.
Speciﬁcally, in Ref. [62], using Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, the authors compute the
cobordism groups ΩSpin
d
(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Γ
)) for 0 ≤d ≤5 and Γ = 1, Z2, Z3, Z6, but their re-
sult for the Γ = Z6 case is not completely determined.
Ref. [62] determines the cobordism groups
ΩSpin
d
(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
)) in 2d and 4d as some undetermined extensions. Namely, they obtain that
ΩSpin
2
(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
)) = e(Z3, Z × Z2), and ΩSpin
4
(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
)) = e(Z3, e(Z3, Z4)) where
e(Q, N) is the group extension of Q by N.
So the group e(Q, N) ﬁts into the short exact sequence
0 →N →e(Q, N) →Q →0 but it may not be uniquely determined.
In contrast, our results are more reﬁned and can uniquely determine the extension in this case. Our
result from Adams spectral sequence demonstrates that each step of extensions is nontrivial, while the
trivial extension yields 3-torsion. Using Adams spectral sequence, we ﬁnd that there is no 3-torsion for
the Γ = Z6 case. So we also provide the solutions to the extension problems in Ref. [62], given by the
nontrivial extension Z →Z →Z3. We obtained the precise answer
ΩSpin
2
(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
)) = Z × Z2
and
ΩSpin
4
(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
)) = Z4.

Standard Models with additional discrete symmetries
In (1.50) and (1.51), we have found the group embedding for the spacetime and internal symmetries of
GUTs and SMs, when the SM groups are Spin(d) × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Zq
with q = 6. Furthermore, inspired
by the SMs with additional discrete symmetries (see some of the earlier work [76–79] and References
therein [50,80]) and motivated by a version of Smith homomorphism map between 5d and 4d bordism
groups [81],
Ω
Spin×Z2Z4
5
= ΩPin+
4
= Z16,
(3.1)
we ﬁnd the following group embedding for the spacetime and internal symmetries for GUTs and the
SMs with additional discrete symmetries (see also [34] for the derivations):
Spin(d) × Spin(10)
ZF
2
⊃Spin(d) ×Z2 Z4 × SU(5) ⊃Spin(d) ×Z2 Z4 × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
Z6
.
(3.2)
Let us discuss the physics role of the group Z4 in Spin(d) ×Z2 Z4:
• The Z4 as a gauge symmetry: The center of Spin(10) is Z(Spin(10)) = Z4, which is naturally
dynamically gauged in the Spin(10) gauge group. So we have [Z4] ⊂[Spin(10)] for SO(10) GUTs,
with the bracket [. . . ] indicating the groups as (part of) gauge groups.
• The Z4 as a global symmetry: However, this Z4 can simply be a part of the internal global
symmetry, for the SU(5) GUT and for the SM with q = 6, assuming that if we do not de-
scend these models from the gauged [Spin(10)] of the SO(10) GUT. This Z4 also contains the
ZF
2
fermion parity (where (−1)F is also a Z2 normal subgroup of the spacetime symmetry
Spin(d)).
Thus Z4 remains ungauged and a global symmetry in Spin(d) ×Z2 Z4 × [SU(5)] and
Spin(d) ×Z2 Z4 × [SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
], even when the bracket [. . . ] become gauge groups, for the
SU(5) GUT and for the SM with q = 6.
We shall study the cobordism theory of the SM groups, Spin ×Z2 Z4 × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Zq
, with q = 1, 2, 3, 6
in the following subsections. For SM with this discrete symmetry, we obtain new anomaly matching
conditions of Z16, Z4 and Z2 classes beyond the familiar Witten anomaly. Depend on whether this Z4 is
a global symmetry or a gauge symmetry, we shall interpret some of the 4d anomalies obtained from the
5d cobordism groups below as ’t Hooft anomalies, and some of others as a dynamical gauge anomalies.
3.1
Spin ×Z2 Z4 × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) model
Below we consider the co/bordism classes relevant for Standard Models with additional discrete symme-
tries.24
We consider G = Spin ×Z2 Z4 × SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1).
24JW is grateful to Miguel Montero [50] for informing his unpublished note [68]. To make comparison, our approach is
based on the Adams spectral sequence, while [50, 68] uses Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS). Two approaches
between ours [31,34] and Garcia-Etxebarria-Montero [50,68] are rather diﬀerent. See more physics implications for future
work, see [68,82].

We consider G = Spin ×Z2 Z4 × SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)

(3.13)
The (B(S(U(3) × U(2))))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space B(S(U(3) × U(2))) and a point,
see footnote 17.
Since
H∗(MSpin ∧(BZ2)2ξ, Z3) = H∗(MSpin, Z3),
(3.14)
and
H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)

This implies that the two classifying spaces BG ∼BSpin × BG′ are homotopy equivalent.
By deﬁnition, the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G is MTG = Thom(BG; −V ),
where V is the induced virtual bundle (of dimension 0) by the map BG →BO.
We can identify BG →BO with BSpin × BG′ V −W+10
−−−−−−→BSO ,→BO.
So the spectrum MTG is homotopy equivalent to Thom(BSpin × BG′; −(V −W + 10)), which is
MTG = MSpin ∧Σ−10MG′.

For the dimension d = t −s < 8, since there is no odd torsion (see footnote 21), by (1.28), we have

So we have the Serre spectral sequence

(4.12)
Let a be the generator of H1(BZ2, Z2), then we have the diﬀerentials d2(a) = w′

SO(10), SO(18) and SO(n) Grand Uniﬁcations
Now we consider the co/bordism classes relevant for Fritzsch-Minkowski SO(10) GUT [7]. There are
actually two cases, depending on whether the gauged SO(10) GUT allows gauge-invariant fermions, or
whether the gauged SO(10) GUT only allows gauge-invariant bosons. The ﬁrst case requires the bordism
group computation of Spin × Spin(n) structure shown in Sec. 5.1, while the second case requires the
bordism group computation of Spin×Spin(n)

structure shown in Sec. 5.3. Because the matter ﬁelds are
in the 16-dimensional complex spinor representation of Spin(10) instead of the 10-dimensional vector
representation of SO(10), we should not consider the Spin × SO(n) structure for SO(10) GUT. However,
we list down bordism group computation of Spin × SO(n) in Sec. 5.2 merely for the convenience of
comparison.
5.1
Spin × Spin(n) for n ≥7: Spin × Spin(10) and Spin × Spin(18)
Here we consider G = Spin × Spin(n) for n ≥7, especially for Spin(10) and Spin(18). The Madsen-
Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G is
MTG = MSpin ∧(BSpin(n))+.
(5.1)
The (BSpin(n))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space BSpin(n) and a point, see footnote 17.
For the dimension d = t −s < 8, since there is no odd torsion (see footnote 21), by (1.28), we have
the Adams spectral sequence
Exts,t
A2(1)(H∗(BSpin(n), Z2), Z2) ⇒ΩSpin×Spin(n)
t−s
.
(5.2)
By [85]’s Theorem 6.5, we have
H∗(BSpin(n), Z2) = H∗(BSO(n), Z2)/(r1, r2, . . . , rh(n)) ⊗Z2[e]
(5.3)
where
H∗(BSO(n), Z2) = Z2[w′
2, w′

(5.4)
and
r1 = w′
2, r2 = Sq1w′
2, r3 = Sq2Sq1w′
2, . . . , rh = Sq2h−2 · · · Sq2Sq1w′
2, . . . .
(5.5)
The value of the function h is
h(8k + 1) = 4k, h(8k + 2) = 4k + 1, h(8k + 3) = h(8k + 4) = 4k + 2,
h(8k + 5) = h(8k + 6) = h(8k + 7) = h(8k + 8) = 4k + 3.
(5.6)
Here 2h(n) is the dimension of the real spinor representation of Spin(n), it is also called the Hurwitz-Radon
number. e ∈H2h(n)(BSpin(n), Z2) is the 2h(n)-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the real spinor representation
∆: BSpin(n) →BO(2h(n)). Here in this subsection, w′
i is the Stiefel-Whitney class of SO(n) bundle.

(5.8)
The (BSO(n))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space BSO(n) and a point, see footnote 17.

There is a homotopy equivalence f : BSO×BSO(n) ∼

and there is obviously also an inverse map. Note that the pullback f∗(w2) = w2(V −W) = w2(V ) +

This implies that the two classifying spaces BG ∼BSpin × BSO(n) are homotopy equivalent.
By deﬁnition, the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G is MTG = Thom(BG; −V ),
where V is the induced virtual bundle (of dimension 0) by the map BG →BO.
We can identify BG →BO with BSpin × BSO(n) V −Vn+n
−−−−−−→BSO ,→BO.
So the spectrum MTG is homotopy equivalent to Thom(BSpin × BSO(n); −(V −Vn + n)), which is
MSpin ∧Σ−nMSO(n).

Physics interpretations of topological terms, anomalies and invert-
ible topological orders
Let us present some explicit examples of topological terms, anomalies and invertible topological orders,
and their interpretations (see also [31]). We shall interpret the new results obtained in our Tables in
Section 2-6 in a similar manner.

When k = 1, the 3d gravitational CS theory is the gravitational background ﬁeld theory, which can
probe the dynamical internal 3d CS gauge theory of gauge group (E8)1. Namely, by integrating out the
internal gauge ﬁelds of (E8)1, we should obtain back the 3d gravitational CS background ﬁeld theory.
Also this bulk internal ﬁeld theory can be equivalently written as at least three CS descriptions:
• First, the 3d (E8)1 CS theory with a gauge group E8 at the level 1.
• Second, a SO(16)1 CS ⊗(a spin TQFT {1, f} with only a trivial line operator 1 and a single
fermionic line f).
• Third, a rank-8 KE8 matrix abelian CS theory Z =

Note that all these internal 3d CS theories can have a 2d boundary CFT with a chiral central charge
c−= 8, namely associated with a E8 chiral boson theory with 8 chiral modes each with c−= 1. This
is a rank-8 K-matrix complex chiral boson theory whose K = KE8. Alternatively, this CFT can also
be formed by gapless 16 multiple of chiral Majorana-Weyl modes, each mode with a c−= 1/2.

(3). Next let us consider the bordism group ΩSO
4 (BSU(2)) = Z2 and ΩSpin
4
(BSU(2)) = Z2 for the internal
symmetry SU(2).
The two bordism invariants of ΩSO
4 (BSU(2)) = Z2 are the signature σ and the
67
second Chern class c2(VSU(2)) of the SU(2) bundle. The two bordism invariants of ΩSpin

are

16 where σ is the signature and the second Chern class c2(VSU(2)) of the SU(2) bundle. We had
already discussed the invariants related to signature σ. Let us focus on the other, but common, bordism
invariant c2(VSU(2)) of ΩSO

Also TP3(SO × SU(2)) = Z2 and TP3(Spin × SU(2)) = Z2. We had discussed one cobordism generator
associated to a multiple of 3d CSgrav. There is another cobordism generator CSSU(2)

We can interpret the Z class co/bordism invariants obtained in our Tables in Section 2-6 in a similar
manner. In this next subsection, we enumerate the interpretations of the 4d anomalies (and 5d cobordism
invariants) for various SM, BSM, and GUT obtained in Section 2-6.
7.2
Interpretations of the 4d anomalies of SM and GUT from co/bordism invariants:
Beyond the Witten anomaly
We can interpret the classiﬁcations of all possible 4d perturbative local and non-perturbative global
invertible anomalies for SM, BSM, and GUTs obtained in Section 2-6 as follows:
1. In Sec 2, we ﬁnd that their 5d cobordism invariants contain the following:
• A Z2 class from the well-known Witten anomaly c2(SU(2))˜η for q = 1, 3. This familiar Witten
SU(2) anomaly disappears from the global anomaly and can be cancelled by a local anomaly
for q = 2, 6 with an internal U(2) symmetry group, see [86] and more discussions below.
• Other Z4 classes from Chern-Simons 5 form like terms from the gauge bundles E of gauge
group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Zq
.
• A Z class from the more exotic µ(PD(c1(U(p)))) constructed from the 3d Rokhlin invariant µ
of the Poincar´e dual of c1(U(p)), where p = 1 for q = 1, while p = 2 for q = 2 or 6, and p = 3
for q = 3 or 6. Note that for q = 6, we identify c1(U(2)) = c1(U(3)) by (2.23).
2. In Sec 3, we ﬁnd that their 5d cobordism invariants contain the following:
c1
=
Tr(F)
2π
,
(7.8)
c2
=
−Tr(F 2) −(Tr(F))2
8π2
,
(7.9)
c3
=
2Tr(F 3) −3Tr(F 2)Tr(F) + Tr(F)3
48π3
, etc.,
(7.10)
also Z = exp(ik(2π)
R
M3 CSSU(2)
3
) is related to instead exp( −i k
4π
R
M3 Tr(AdA −i 2
3A3)).
69
• The Z5 classes are similar to Sec 2.
Again one of a Z class is from the more exotic
µ(PD(c1(U(3)))). The other four Z4 class are from Chern-Simons 5 form like terms from
the gauge bundles E.
• For q = 2, 6, there is a new Z2 class anomaly as ac2(U(2)).
For q = 1, 3, there is a new Z4 class c2(SU(2))η′ via a short exact sequence 0 →Z2 →Z4 →
Z2 →0. The original Witten anomaly c2(SU(2))˜η sits at the Z2 normal subgroup of Z4. The
c2(SU(2))a = ac2(SU(2)) with a ∈H1(BZ2, Z2) sits at the Z2 quotient. Thus the Z4 class
generator c2(SU(2))η′ sitting at the extended total group is beyond the Witten anomaly. The
same structure occurs for the classes of the levels,
0 →k ∈Z2 →ktotal ∈Z4 →kQ ∈Z2 →0,
where k, ktotal, and kQ label the levels of those cobordism invariants respectively.27
• A Z16 is η(PD(a)) from Ω
Spin×Z2Z4
5
= Z16. On 5-manifolds with Spin ×Z2 Z4 structure, there
is a Pin+ structure on PD(a) and there is an isomorphism Ω
Spin×Z2Z4
5
∩a
−→ΩPin+
4
[81].
• A Z4 class is from c1(U(1))2η′ (for q = 1), or c1(U(2))2η′ (for q = 2, 6), or c1(U(3))2η′ (for
q = 3, 6). The η′ is a Z4 valued 1d eta invariant. Note that for q = 6, we have c1(U(2))2η′ =
c1(U(3))2η′ because we identify c1(U(2)) = c1(U(3)) by (2.23).
• A Z2 class is from ac2(SU(3)) (for q = 1, 2) or ac2(U(3)) (for q = 3, 6).
The last three cobordism invariants in 5d of Z16, Z4, and Z2, are also beyond the Witten
anomaly.
3. In Sec 4, for Spin ×Z2 (SU(4) ×Zq (SU(2) × SU(2))),
• With q = 2, we have a Z class of a Chern-Simons 5-form in 5d from Euler class e6(SO(6)) in
6d. We also have other two Z2 classes: w2(SO(6))w3(SO(6)) and w2(SO(4))w3(SO(4)) in 5d.
Since w2 = w2(SO(6))+w2(SO(4)), w3 = w3(SO(6))+w3(SO(4)) and w2(SO(6))w3(SO(4))+
w2(SO(4))w3(SO(6)) = Sq1(w2(SO(6))w2(SO(4))) = w1w2(SO(6))w2(SO(4)) = 0 by Wu for-
mula, we have w2w3 = w2(SO(6))w3(SO(6)) + w2(SO(4))w3(SO(4)).
• With q = 1, we also have a Z class of a Chern-Simons 5-form in 5d from Euler class e6(SO(6))
in 6d, and other three Z2 classes: w2w3 = w2(SO(6))w3(SO(6)) = w2(SO(4))w3(SO(4)),
w4(SO(4))˜η,
and (f∗)−1(c2(SU(2))˜η) in 5d.
Here f
:
ΩSpin×SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4)
d
→
Ω
Spin×Z2(SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4))
d
is the natural group homomorphism, f∗is the induced map be-
tween bordism invariants.
4. In Sec 5, for n ≥7, for Spin × Spin(n) and Spin × SO(n), we have no cobordism invariants in 5d.
For Spin ×Z2 Spin(n), we have w2w3 = w2(TM)w3(TM) = w2(VSO(n))w3(VSO(n)) in 5d.
5. In Sec 6, for Spin × SU(5), we have Chern-Simons 5-form in 5d from the Chern class c3(SU(5)) in
6d.
The diﬀerence between q = 1 and q = 2 cases in Sec. 2 is that the Witten anomaly c2(SU(2))˜η of Z2 for
q = 1 vanishes in q = 2, while in contrast the CSU(1)
1
c2(SU(2)) ∼c1(U(1))CSSU(2)

of Z for q = 1 becomes
1
2CSU(2)
1
c2(U(2)) ∼1
2c1(U(2))CSU(2)
3
in q = 2. The CSU(1)
1
c2(SU(2)) in 5d comes from c1(U(1))c2(U(2))
in 6d. Due to the nontrivial diﬀerential d1 in Figure 48 for q = 2, the c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) mod 2 in 6d and
27Say
in
terms
of
the
partition
functions,
they
are
exp(ik 2π
2 c2(SU(2))˜η),
exp(iktotal 2π
4 c2(SU(2))η′).
and
exp(ikQ 2π
2 c2(SU(2))a).
70
the Witten anomaly from the 5d term c2(U(2))˜η cancel with each other, while the 1
2c1(U(2))c2(U(2))
remains for q = 2. Here the c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) mod 2 is the quotient Z2, the c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) is the
total Z, and the 1
2c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) is the normal Z in the short exact sequence 0 →Z
2→Z →Z2 →0.
Let us express the levels of those cobordism invariants as kq=2, kq=1, and k′
q=1 respectively.28 In fact, we
can also understand the short exact sequence as the classes of the levels: 0 →kq=1 ∈Z
2→kq=2 ∈Z →
k′
q=1 ∈Z2 →0. There is yet another way to explain why c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) mod 2 vanishes for q = 2:
Namely by Wu formula, the c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) = Sq2c2(U(2)) = (w2 + w2
1)c2(U(2)) = 0 mod 2 on the
Spin 6-manifolds.
The diﬀerence between q = 3 and q = 6 cases in Sec. 2 is that the Witten anomaly c2(SU(2))˜η
of Z2 for q = 3 vanishes in q = 6, while in contrast the CSU(3)
1
c2(SU(2)) ∼c1(U(3))CSSU(2)
3
of Z
for q = 3 becomes the 1
2CSU(3)
1
c2(U(2)) ∼
1
2c1(U(3))CSU(2)
3
in q = 6.
There is yet another way to
explain why c1(U(3))c2(U(2)) mod 2 vanishes for q = 6: Namely by Wu formula, c1(U(3))c2(U(2)) =
c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) = Sq2c2(U(2)) = (w2 + w2
1)c2(U(2)) = 0 mod 2 on Spin 6-manifolds. In short, the
situations of q = 3 and q = 6 are exactly parallel to the situations of q = 1 and q = 2 discussed above.
The diﬀerence between q = 1 and q = 2 cases in Sec. 3 is that the global Witten SU(2) anomaly of
Z2 class in q = 1 becomes a local anomaly a2CSU(2)

for q = 1 becomes the right two part which start from c2(U(2)) and c2(U(2))a respectively for q = 2.
For q = 1, the left part which starts from c2(SU(2)) contributes a Z4 class c2(SU(2))η′ in 5d. For q = 2,
the right part which starts from c2(U(2))a contributes a Z2 class c2(U(2))a in 5d, while the right part
which starts from c2(U(2)) contributes a Z class a2c2(U(2))+c1(U(2))c2(U(2))
2
in 6d. There is yet another way
to explain why a2c2(U(2)) + c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) mod 2 vanishes for q = 2. Namely by Wu formula, the
c1(U(2))c2(U(2)) = Sq2(c2(U(2))) = (w2 + w2
1)c2(U(2)) = a2c2(U(2)) mod 2 on Spin 6-manifolds.
The diﬀerence between q = 3 and q = 6 cases in Sec. 3 is that the global Witten SU(2) anomaly of
Z2 class in q = 3 becomes a local anomaly a2CSU(2)

What we have found here is consistent with the fact that the Witten anomaly as a global non-
perturbative anomaly becomes a local perturbative anomaly, whenever we change from q = 1 to q = 2,
or change from q = 3 to q = 6, which trades the SU(2) internal symmetry for the U(2) internal
symmetry [86].

Conclusions, and Explorations on Non-Perturbative and Topologi-
cal Sectors of BSM

We also have
interpreted the classiﬁcations of various 4d perturbative local and non-perturbative global invertible
anomalies for SM and GUTs in Sec. 7.
Below we summarize the results of co/bordism groups and
conclude with further implications.

Compared to Sec. 2, there are new bordism invariants. For example, in 1d, ˜η becomes η′ which is
Z4 valued. In 4d, the σ
16 becomes σ−F·F
8
where F is the characteristic 2-surface [75] in a 4-manifold
M4, it satisﬁes the condition F · x = x · x mod 2 for all x ∈H2(M4, Z). Here · is the intersection
form of M4. By the Freedman-Kirby theorem, (σ−F·F
8
)(M4) = Arf(M4, F) mod 2. When M4 is
Spin, F can be chosen to be 0 since the intersection form of M4 is even (x · x = 0 mod 2). So in
this case, σ
8 (M4) = 0 mod 2, thus the bordism invariant is σ
16. In 5d, there is a new η(PD(a)) since
there is an induced Pin+ structure on PD(a) where η is the 4d eta invariant, PD is the Poincar´e
dual.

Constraints on Quantum Dynamics
We have discussed and summarized potential anomalies and topological terms in SM, GUT and BSM.
There are actually two versions of anomalies we are speaking of: One is the Anomaly (2)for the ungauged
SM, GUT and BSM with the G is simply a global symmetry. Another is the Anomaly (3)for the gauged
SM, GUT and BSM with the Ginternal dynamically gauged inside G. In more details,
I. For ungauged SM, GUT and BSM, we can use the ’t Hooft anomaly (Anomaly (2)) to the gappability
of these models’ matter ﬁeld sectors. For ungauged SM, GUT and BSM, we can simply have matter
ﬁeld contents (e.g. fermions: quarks and leptons) without dynamical gauge ﬁelds. In fact, Ref. [51–53]
use the all anomaly free conditions to support that a non-perturbative deﬁnition (lattice regularization)
of SO(10) GUT is doable, by checking. By anomaly free, there exists non-perturbative interactions for
gapping the mirror world chiral fermions [55]. This mirror-fermion gapping can help to get rid of the
mirror world chiral fermion doublers, surpassing the Nielsen-Ninomiya fermion doubling theorem (which
is only true for the free non-interacting systems). The fact that all anomaly free gapless theories can be
deformed to a fully gapped trivial vacuum is also consistent with the concept of Seiberg’s deformation
class [87]. More details can be found in [55].
II. For gauged SM, GUT and BSM, we can use the dynamical gauge anomaly matching conditions
(Anomaly (3)) to rule out inconsistent theories. Importantly, depending on the matter contents and
their representations in Ginternal, we may gain or loss some global symmetries. For example, for fermions
in the adjoint representation, we can have a 1-form center symmetry for the gauge theory. Thus, we
should beware potentially additional new higher ’t Hooft anomalies (see [31,34]) for gauged SM, GUT
and BSM can help us to constrain quantum dynamics (also more discussions below).
73
We use the path integral and the action to understand the basic kinematics and the global symmetry
of the QFTs. We can apply the spacetime geometric topology properties to constrain QFTs, such as
doing the spacetime surgery for QFTs [88–91]. We can also determine the anomalies of QFTs at UV.
However, given the potentially complete anomalies, we can constrain the IR dynamics by UV-IR anomaly
matching. The consequence of anomaly matching implies that the IR theories with ’t Hooft anomalies
in G-symmetry must be matched by at least one of the following dynamics scenarios:
1. Symmetry-breaking:
• (say, discrete or continuous G-symmetry breaking).
2. Symmetry-preserving:
• Degenerate ground states (like the “Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem [92,93]”),
• Gapless, e.g., conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT),
• Symmetry-preserving TQFT: Intrinsic topological orders.
3. Symmetry-extension [94]: Symmetry-extension is a rather exotic possibility, which does not occur
naturally without ﬁne-tuning or artiﬁcial designed, explained in [94]. However, the symmetry-
extension approach is a useful intermediate stepstone, to construct another earlier scenario:
symmetry-preserving TQFT, via gauging the extended-symmetry [94].
In more details, suppose there are mixed anomalies between the ordinary 0-form global symmetries
and higher-form symmetries (say 1-form symmetries) in the certain gauged SM, GUT, and BSM as in
Model II, we have further reﬁnement of possibilities:
(i) Ordinary 0-form symmetry broken (spontaneously or explicitly).
(ii) 1-form center discrete Ze
N,[1] symmetry broken (spontaneously or explicitly) as deconﬁnement:
(2-i) 1-form Ze
N,[1]-symmetry breaking and deconﬁned TQFTs, i.e., topological order in condensed
matter terminology.
(2-ii) 1-form Ze
N,[1]-symmetry breaking and deconﬁned gapless theories (e.g. CFTs).
(iii) 1-form center discrete Ze
N,[1] symmetry unbroken as conﬁnement:
(3-i) 1-form symmetry-extended invertible TQFT: The exotic scenario of symmetry-extended in-
vertible TQFT is systematically studied in Ref. [94]. This idea is generalized to higher sym-
metries for higher-symmetry-extended invertible TQFT in Ref. [29].
(3-ii) 1-form symmetry-preserving TQFT: In fact, under certain criteria, there is a no go theorem
to match some speciﬁc anomalies by this scenario. Hinted by the obstruction of constructing
the symmetry-extended TQFTs [18, 29], Cordova-Ohmori [95] proved a no go theorem for
TQFTs preserving both the 1-form symmetry and time-reversal symmetry while saturating
the 4d SU(N) YM anomaly with θ = π.
(iv) Full symmetry-preserving gapless theory (e.g. CFTs).
In summary, based on the kinematics, global symmetries (ordinary or higher symmetries), anomalies
and spacetime topology constraints, we may suggest new quantum dynamical constraints.

8.3
Anomaly Cancellation or Anomaly-Matched Hidden Sectors for Beyond Stan-
dard Models
The previous section also has phenomenology implications of the gauged SM, GUT, and BSM as in
Model II.
• Suppose we prove that the theory is fully ’t Hooft anomaly free (for global symmetries, not the
dynamical gauge anomalies), then there is an application for gapping the mirror world chiral
fermions (see Ref. [51–53,55] and References therein).
• Suppose we prove that the theory has a certain ’t Hooft anomaly (for global symmetries, not the
dynamical gauge anomalies), then we discover either of the following (see more details in):
1. Anomaly-Matched Topological Field Theories: Anomaly-Matched Hidden Topological Sectors. The
gapped topological sector has its low energy physics described by a certain TQFT. But the gapped
topological sector may have a ﬁnite energy gap ∆E (instead of inﬁnite large gap ∆E →∞) which has
experimental measurable consequences.
2. Anomaly-Matched Hidden Gapless Sectors: This may be more surprising for phenomenology grounds
with additional massless or gapless beyond SM around the energy scale ∆E with anyonic excitations of
particles, strings or branes (e.g. see [90,91,96] and References therein).
3. Anomaly-Matched Symmetry-Breaking Sectors: Global symmetries can be spontaneously broken.
4. All Anomaly-Free conditions are matched: This suggests the relation between the gapping criteria and
deﬁning fermion/gauge theories. In particular, the challenge of deﬁning chiral fermion/gauge theories
can be overcome by gapping the mirror world chiral fermions [51–53,55].
5. Swapland Implications and Defects: In the recent work of McNamara-Vafa [61], by combing the ideas of
Quantum Gravity/String Landscape and Swampland (e.g. Ref. [97,98], see a review [99]) together with
no internal global symmetry for quantum gravity [100–103], Ref. [61] argues that all the cobordism
classes in the full Quantum Gravity (QG) must be vanished as in the trivial class. Eﬀectively, the
eﬀective cobordism classes of QG named Ω
g
QG
k
must be vanished. This gives several powerful constraints
for the cobordism class data in any dimension. If we ﬁnd any anomalies or topological terms in lower
dimensions, say k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in our case, this suggests that in the full QG, their cobordism classes must
be cancelled by some other new objects/excitations/extended operators. Two particular interesting
possibilities are [61]:
(1). Symmetry is broken: Mathematically, this suggests a map
Ω
g
QG
k
→Ω
g
QG+defects
k
,
(8.1)
which means the cancellation of cobordism classes via new additional symmetry defects. Namely,
the kernel in Ω
g
QG
k
of this map is mapped to a trivial class in Ω
g
QG+defects
k
.
(2). Symmetry is gauged: Mathematically, this suggests a map
Ω
g
QG+gauge sectors
k
→Ω
g
QG
k
,
(8.2)
which means the cancellation of cobordism classes via additional new gauge sectors. Namely, the
cokernel in Ω
g
QG
k
of this map is mapped reversely to a trivial class in Ω
g
QG+gauge sectors
k
.
75
We leave the further detailed explorations of the above predictions in upcoming works [27,34,82].

29The topological terms of 4d gauge theories in Ref. [104] are related to the bordism invariants that we enumerate in our
present work, and also those bordism invariants enumerated in Ref. [18].
30Although the methods of ours [31,34] and theirs [50,62] are rather diﬀerent: ours is via Adams spectral sequence, while
theirs is via Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. In addition, we can conveniently read the iTQFT (namely, co/bordism
invariants) from the Adams chart [31,34] , while iTQFT cannot be extracted easily from Ref. [50,62].

Comment on the diﬀerence between Standard Models
There is a Z2 valued bordism invariant of Ω
Spin× SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Zq
5
for q = 1, 3 while not for q = 2, 6. In this
appendix, we will comment on this diﬀerence.
There is no odd torsion in the bordism groups Ω
Spin× SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Zq
d
(see footnote 21).
So
we
only
need
to
use
the
mod

spectral
sequence
whose

is
only
the

Since
H∗(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z3
), Z2)
=
H∗(B(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)), Z2)
and
H∗(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z6
), Z2)
=
H∗(B( SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z2
), Z2).
So the results of bordism groups
ΩSpin×SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
d
and Ω

are the same. So we need only to comment on the diﬀer-
ence between q = 1 and 2. For q = 1, there is an SU(2) factor in SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1). While for q = 2,
there is a U(2) factor in SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
Z2
= U(2) × SU(3). Consider the second Chern class c2 in both
cases. We have H∗(BSU(2), Z2) = Z2[c2] while H∗(BU(2), Z2) = Z2[c1, c2]. In H∗(BSU(2), Z2), Sq2c2 = 0,
while in H∗(BU(2), Z2), Sq2c2 = c1c2. The local diﬀerence between the A2(1)-module structures is shown
80

Pati-Salam model and bordism invariants
The red part in Figure 26 corresponds to the three bordism invariants in Table 19 which are hard to
describe directly, but the reduction of Spin × SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(4) structure to Spin ×Z2 (SU(2) ×

will try to express the three bordism invariants corresponding to the red part in Figure 26 with the help
of f.
We can compute ΩSpin×SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4)

using the Adams spectral sequence. For G = Spin×SU(2)×
SU(2) × SU(4), the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MTG of the group G is
MTG = MSpin ∧(B(SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(4)))+.
(D.2)
The (B(SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4)))+ is the disjoint union of the classifying space B(SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(4))
and a point, see footnote 17.
For the dimension d = t −s < 8, since there is no odd torsion (see footnote 21), by (1.28), we have
the Adams spectral sequence

The A2(1)-module structure of H∗(B(SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(4)), Z2) below degree 6 and the E2 page
are shown in Figure 50, 51. Here we have used the correspondence between A2(1)-module structure and
the E2 page shown in Figure 35 and 37.

2n−1 or CSG
2n−1 is the Chern-Simons form of the vector bundle V or the associated vector bundle of
the principal G-bundle (associated to the Chern/Pontryagin class).
We ﬁnd that the red part in Figure 26 is related to the red part in Figure 51. More precisely, the
image of the red part in Figure 51 under the group homomorphism f is exactly the red part in Figure
26. So we can express the three bordism invariants corresponding to the red part in Figure 26 as we
did in in Table 19. Correspondingly, we can express the topological term corresponding to the Z valued
bordism invariant as we did in Table 20. Notice that a bordism invariant is a homomorphism from the
bordism group to its cyclic factor, while by (1.23), the free parts of bordism group and cobordism group
are related by
(TPd(G))free = Hom((ΩG
d+1)free, Z).
(D.4)
So both f∗and g are dual to f.

Another form of one of the bordism invariants of Ω
Spin×Z2Spin(n)
4
The group homomorphism Spin ×Z2 Spin(n) →SO induces a reduction of Spin ×Z2 Spin(n)-structures
to SO-structures, this yields a group homomorphism h : Ω
Spin×Z2Spin(n)
d
→ΩSO
d .
In particular, for
d = 4, the bordism invariant of ΩSO
4
= Z is the signature σ. There is a Z valued bordism invariant of
Ω
Spin×Z2Spin(n)
4
which can be expressed as h∗(σ). On the other hand, there is an SO(n) bundle VSO(n)
with w2(TM) = w2(VSO(n)). In our computation in Sec. 5.3, we ﬁnd that there is a Z valued bordism
invariant of Ω
Spin×Z2Spin(n)
4
which can be expressed as p1(VSO(n)). We ﬁnd that p1(VSO(n)) and h∗(σ)
are the same. Since p1(VSO(n)) = w2(VSO(n))2 = w2(TM)2 mod 2 and σ = 3σ = p1(TM) = w2(TM)2
mod 2, p1(VSO(n)) and h∗(σ) are the same modulo 2. While we can ﬁnd the manifold generator for this
Z valued bordism invariant, it is exactly CP2 with the natural Spinc = Spin×Z2 Spin(2) structure. Since
this Spinc structure implies a Spin×Z2 Spin(n) structure for all n ≥2 (just take VSO(n) = VSO(2) ⊕Rn−2),
p1(VSO(n)) = p1(VSO(2)) = −c2(VSO(2) ⊗R C) = −c2(VSO(2) ⊕VSO(2)) = c1(VSO(2))2 = 1. On the other
hand, σ(CP2) = 1. So p1(VSO(n)) and h∗(σ) have the same value on the manifold generator CP2. So they
are the same bordism invariant.
