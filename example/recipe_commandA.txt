## Procedure:
1. **Synthesis of 2DPA-1:**
   - Add 126 mg (1 mmol) of melamine and 265 mg (1 mmol) of trimesic acid trichloride to a 40-ml glass vial equipped with a stir bar.
   - Add 9 ml of *N*-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 1 ml of pyridine to the vial.
   - Stir the mixture at room temperature (20–25 ºC) for 16 hours until a gel forms.
   - Cut the gel into small pieces and soak in 80 ml of ethyl alcohol, followed by 30-min bath sonication.
   - Filter or centrifuge the mixture, then wash with 80 ml of deionized water and 80 ml of acetone.
   - Dry the resulting pale-yellow powder in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 16 hours.

2. **Preparation of 2DPA-1 Nanofilms:**
   - Dissolve 2DPA-1 powder in trifluoroacetic acid to form a homogeneous solution.
   - Spin-coat the solution onto a clean SiO₂-covered Si wafer at 2000 rpm for 1 minute to obtain a uniform nanofilm.
   - Measure film thickness using AFM at scratches made by a fine needle.

3. **Synthesis of TMS-2DPA-1 (for AFM imaging):**
   - Add 10 mg of 2DPA-1 to a 4-ml glass vial, followed by 2 ml of CHCl₃, 0.3 ml of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and 0.5 ml of triethylamine.
   - Stir the mixture at room temperature until a black homogeneous solution forms.
   - Dilute the reaction solution without purification and deposit directly onto mica for AFM characterization.

## Notes:
- All synthetic steps should be conducted in a well-ventilated fume hood.
- Ensure proper disposal of solvents and chemicals according to laboratory guidelines.
- The drying step is critical for obtaining high-purity 2DPA-1 powder.
- For AFM imaging, the TMS-2DPA-1 modification is essential to break hydrogen bonding and enable discrete molecular imaging.
- Film thickness can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the 2DPA-1 solution in TFA.
