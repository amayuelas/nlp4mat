## Procedure:
    1. Reaction Mixture:
       - Add $126 \, \text{mg}$ (1 mmol) of melamine and $265 \, \text{mg}$ (1 mmol) of trimesic acid trichloride to a 40-mL vial equipped with a stir bar
       - Add $9 \, \text{mL}$ of *N*-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and $1 \, \text{mL}$ of pyridine
       - Stir the mixture at room temperature ($20-25\,^\circ\text{C}$) for $16 \, \text{h}$
       - Wait for the mixture to turn into a gel
    2. Gel Processing:
       - Cut the gel into small pieces
       - Soak in $80 \, \text{ml}$ of ethyl alcohol
       - Perform $30\text{-min}$ bath sonication if needed
    3. Purification:
       - Filter or centrifuge the cloudy mixture
       - Wash the residue with $80 \, \text{ml}$ of deionized water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and $80 \, \text{ml}$ of acetone
    4. Drying:
       - Dry the washed residue under house vacuum at $100\,^\circ\text{C}$ for $16 \, \text{h}$
       - Collect the resulting pale-yellow powder; yield: $228 \, \text{mg}$ ($81 \%$)

## Notes:
