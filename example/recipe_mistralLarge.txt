## Procedure:
    1. Preparation of the Reaction Mixture:
       - Weigh out 126 mg (1 mmol) of melamine and 265 mg (1 mmol) of trimesic acid trichloride
       - Add these to a 40 mL vial equipped with a stir bar
       - Add 9 mL of *N*-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 1 mL of pyridine to the vial
       - Stir the mixture at room temperature (20–25 ºC)
    2. Gel Formation:
       - Continue stirring for 16 hours until the reaction mixture forms a gel
    3. Purification:
       - Cut the gel into small pieces
       - Soak the pieces in 80 mL of ethyl alcohol
       - Perform bath sonication for 30 minutes if necessary
       - Filter or centrifuge the resulting cloudy mixture
       - Wash the filtered or centrifuged product with 80 mL of deionized water and 80 mL of acetone
    4. Drying:
       - Dry the product in a vacuum oven at 100°C for 16 hours
    5. Storage:
       - Store the resulting pale-yellow powder in a clean, dry container

## Notes:
    - The reaction should be conducted under ambient conditions.
    - The resulting 2DPA-1 powder can be further processed into nanofilms or other forms for characterization and application.
    - The purity and yield of the product can be verified using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and other analytical techniques.
